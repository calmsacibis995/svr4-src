The address entered is not of the correct format.
Internet addresses are a sequence of four integers
(separated by dots (".")).  Within a small network,
the first three integers are the same.  For example,
the address of machine "elvis" might be

	192.11.109.01

and the address of machine "james" might be

	192.11.109.02
