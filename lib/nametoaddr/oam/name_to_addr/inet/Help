ABSTRACT:
	This item adds machine and service information to the
	address files of the internet protocols.
	Once added, applications can obtain machine and service
	addresses using the name to address mapping facility.

menu:host:Host Information
	This item adds machine names and addresses into
	the hosts file for the internet protocols.

menu:services:Service Information
	This item adds service names and port numbers into
	the services file for the internet protocols.

inet:name:Machine Information
	Please enter the name of a machine that is accessable
	via the internet protocol.

inet:addr:Address Information
	Please enter the internet address for the machine
	entered on the previous line.
	Internet addresses are a sequence of four integers
	(separated by dots (".")).  Within a small network,
	the first three integers are the same.  For example,
	the address of machine "elvis" might be
	
		192.11.109.01
	
	and the address of machine "james" might be
	
		192.11.109.02

inet:service:Service Information
	Please enter the name of a service available on machines
	that are accessable via the internet protocol.

inet:port:Port Information
	Please enter the service port number for the service
	given in the previous line.
	Internet service port numbers are simple
	integers (and they must be the same on each machine).
	For example, the port number of service "rpc" is
	
			111
	
	and the port number of service "listen" is
	
			1025
