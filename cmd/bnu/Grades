#ident	"@(#)bnu:Grades	1.1"
#
#	Grades provides a orderly means of partitioning queued jobs into
#	workloads that compete amongst its own type. Workloads can be partioned 
#	according to size of the jobs, on a priority basis or a combination
#	of both. Along with each grades is a list of users or groups that can
#	use the grade, so that only select users can use the job grade.
#	Partitioning of workloads is to be set by the uucp or system administrator.
#
#	Format:
#
#	user_job_grade			an ascii string that defines a
#					grade for a workload partition.
#	system_job_grade		an ascii character, A-Z, a-z,
#					with A having the higest priority
#					and z with the lowest priority.
#	job_size			a number which is the maximum limit
#					of bytes that a job can have to
#					be placed in the queue. There are
#					shorthand expressions that can be used
#					to code the job_size field. K, M, and
#					Any can used and have the meaning kilo-
#					byte, megabyte, and no maximum,
#					respectively. K and M must have an
#					integer prefix.
#	permit_type			a keyword that denotes how to interpret
#					the id_list is contained in this field.
#					User, non-user, group, non-group are
#					the only valid arguments of this field.
#	id_list				a list of login names or group names
#					that are permitted or denied to queue
#					jobs to this job grade. The list is to
#					be seperated by whitespace and terminated
#					by a newline character. The reserved word
#					Any is used permit anyone to queue to
#					a job grade if User is the permit_type.
#
#	Since the user job grade may be bound to more than one system job grade,
#	it is important to note that the Grades file will be searched 
#	sequentially for occurences of a user job grade. Since the names of
#	user job grades may not be the same from system to system, we have
#	reserved the names of three job grades so that the user may see some
#	similiarity across different systems.
#
#	If the Grades file does not exist or it is unreadable, then user defined
#	grades will not be allowed on the system.
