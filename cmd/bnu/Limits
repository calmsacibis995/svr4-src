#
# 	Limits provides a means of specifying the maximum number of
#	simultaneous uucicos, uuxqts, and uuscheds that are permitted.
#	5 uucicos, 2 uuxqts, and 2 uuscheds are reasonable.
#
#	FORMAT:
#
#	service=<service name> max=<number>
#
#	where <service name> is "uucico" or "uuxqt" or "uusched",
#	      <number> is the limit that is permitted for that service.
#	The fields are order insensitive, case sensitive, and the first
#	match in the file wins.
#
#	If the Limits file does not exist or it is unreadable or <number>
#	is not a positive number, then there will  no overall limit
#	for that service.
