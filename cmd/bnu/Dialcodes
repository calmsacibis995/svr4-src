#
#	The Dialcodes file contains dial-code abbreviations
#	that can be used in the 'Phone' field of the Systems
#	file. Each entry has the format:
#
#		abbr	dial-seq
#
#	where 'abbr' is the abbreviation used in the Systems
#	file 'Phone' field, and 'dial-seq' is the dial sequence
#	that is passed to the dialer when that particular Systems
#	file entry is accessed.

#	Example 1:	chicago	1312
#	Example 2:	chicago 9=1312
