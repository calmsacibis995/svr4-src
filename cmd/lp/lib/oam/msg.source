 ** This file contains definitions for the E_... symbols

 ** The E_... symbols go into a header file, and the text
 ** go into separate, compilable files.

 * Format of lines in this file:

 *	E_...
 *		"text-for-error-message"
 *		"text-for-TO-FIX-statement"
 *
 * Lines that DON'T begin with E_..., " (double quote), or #
 * (after leading spaces or tabs) are skipped. Thus these comment
 * lines are ignored, but the C preprocessor directives are kept.
 *
 * Note: The preprocessor directives DO NOT keep text from being
 * generated, nor do they keep the E_... symbols from being numbered
 * (which is consistent). The directives ARE useful for keeping them
 * from being needlessly defined in a program that includes "oam.h"
