#
# Used by makemap to build ASCII font and device files that can be used
# by dimpress when it tries to print files formatted for the MHCC APS-5
# using raster files in directory ..
#
# makemap reads this file, the ASCII font files for the APS-5, and the
# binary font files for device i300. It was run in directory .. using a
# command line that looks something like,
#
#
#	makemap -mi300 -Ssource_dir -Fbinary_dir aps
#
#
# where source_dir is wherever you keep the ASCII font files for the APS-5
# (minus the suffix "/devaps") and binary_dir tells the program where to
# look for the binary font files for the device selected using the -m
# option. In this case it expects to find a directory "binary_dir/devi300".
#
# All these extra files are really just used to map font+character pairs
# for the APS-5 into pairs that can be used with the raster files in
# directory ... A lot of the extra files could be eliminated by omitting
# the S font from the map list, since the post-processor searches all the
# special fonts anyway. But including S makes sure we can print characters
# in the requested font no matter what other fonts have been mounted.
