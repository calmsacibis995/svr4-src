Postscript definitions of some special troff characters. For now each file
is named by its two character troff name and is copied to the output file,
as is, when the character is first used. Each procedure is called with a
single argument, namely the width of the character. The name of the PostScript
procedure that builds the character must begin with the prefix build_ and
end with the character's name.

The following variables are defined in dpost.ps and may help when you're building
a new character:

  font		name of the current font
  ptsize	and the point size
  size		Postscript is using this size - it's scaled up from ptsize
