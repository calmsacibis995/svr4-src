/*
 *
 * dpost - troff post-processor for PostScript printers.
 *
 * A program that translates output generated by the device independent troff
 * into PostScript. Much was borrowed from dimpress and dps (formally dlzw),
 * and even though the code has been changed, credit has to be given to Richard
 * Flood for his early work on the PostScript driver.
 *
 * Among the most interesting new features are color support (see devcntrl() and
 * file color.c) and code to handle complex paths pieced together using any of the
 * standard drawing commands (see devcntrl() and file draw.c). Reverse video mode
 * has also been included as a special case of the color support. Two encoding
 * schemes based on widthshow are also new additions. The safe one is obtained when
 * you set encoding to 2 (eg. using the -e2 option). The slightly faster method
 * is obtained by setting encoding to 3 (eg. using the -e3 option), although it's
 * not recommended. Rounding errors in character widths can accumulate and become
 * quite noticeable by the time you get to the right margin. More often than not
 * you end up getting a ragged right margin.
 *
 * The program handles files formatted for any device, although the best and
 * most efficient output is generated when the font and description files match
 * PostScript's resident fonts. Device emulation is relatively expensive, and
 * can produce output files that are more than twice the size of the input files.
 * In most cases output files will be smaller than input files, perhaps by up to
 * 40 percent, although the results you get depend on what you're doing and the
 * text encoding you're using. You'll get the worst results if you're emulating
 * another device, using special bitmap characters, like the logo, or doing lots
 * of vertical motion or drawing.
 *
 * PostScript fonts don't support all of troff's characters, so some have to
 * be built by special PostScript procedures. Those routines can be found in
 * *fontdir/devpost/charlib, and are only used when we try to print a character
 * that has been assigned a code less than 32. Definitions are only made the
 * first time each character is used. Subsequent requests to print the character
 * only generate a call to the PostScript procedure that's been copied to the
 * output file. For example you'll find a file called sq in directory
 * *fontdir/devpost/charlib. It defines a PostScript procedure called build_sq
 * that's called whenever we need to print a square. Special characters that
 * have been assigned a code of 2 are expected to come in two pieces. The
 * definition part and bitmap part (or whatever). The definition is only made
 * once, but the contents of the character's .map file are copied to the output
 * file each time, immediately after charlib() generates the call to the
 * PostScript procedure (build_??) that builds the character. That's typically
 * how logos built from bitmaps would be handled.
 *
 * Several different methods can be used to encode lines of text. What's done
 * depends on the value assigned to encoding. Print time should decrease as
 * encoding increases (up to MAXENCODING). Setting encoding to 0, which should
 * probably be the default, produces output essentially identical to the original
 * version of dpost. It's the slowest but most stable method of encoding lines of
 * text, and won't be bothered by rounding errors in the font width tables that
 * could become noticeable by the time you get to the end of a line. Other schemes
 * seem to work, but aren't well tested and are not guaranteed for all possible
 * jobs. encoding can be changed on the command line using the -e option. Part of
 * the support for different encoding schemes was to move control of all text
 * related output to separate routines. It makes dpost work harder, but changing
 * things is easy. For example adding stuff to support widthshow took less than
 * an hour.
 *
 * According to Adobe's structuring conventions, the output produced by dpost is
 * still nonconforming. Global definitions that are occasionally made in individual
 * pages are the primary problem. Among other things they handle downloading host
 * resident fonts and defining special characters not generally available on
 * PostScript printers. The approach used here works on a demand basis and violates
 * page independence. A definition is made once in the first page that needs it
 * and is bracketed by PostScript code that ensures the definition is exported to
 * the global environment where it will be available for use by all the pages that
 * follow.  Simple changes, like downloading definitions the first time they're
 * used in each page, restores page independence but wouldn't be an efficient
 * solution. Other approaches are also available, but every one I've considered
 * sacrifices much in efficiency - just to maintain page independence. I'll leave
 * things be for now. Global definitions made in individual pages are bracketed
 * by %%BeginGlobal and %%EndGlobal comments and can easily be pulled out of
 * individual pages and put in the prologue by utility programs like postreverse.
 *
 * I've also added code that handles the DOCUMENTFONTS comment, although it's
 * only produced for those fonts in directory /usr/lib/font/devpost that have an
 * associated .name file. The first string in a .name file should be the (long)
 * PostScript name (eg. Times-Roman in R.name). For now everything else in the
 * .name file is ignored, although that may also change. You'll find .name files
 * for all the supported fonts in the devpost source directory, although they may
 * not be installed in /usr/lib/font/devpost.
 *
 * The PostScript prologue is copied from *prologue before any of the input files
 * are translated. The program expects the following procedures are avaliable:
 *
 *	setup
 *
 *	  mark ... setup -
 *
 *	    Handles special initialization stuff that depends on how the program
 *	    was called. Expects to find a mark followed by key/value pairs on the
 *	    stack. The def operator is applied to each pair up to the mark, then
 *	    the default state is set up. An 'x res' command must preceed the
 *	    'x init' command!
 *
 *	pagesetup
 *
 *	  page pagesetup -
 *
 *	    Called at the start of each page, immediately after the page level
 *	    save, to do special initialization on a per page basis. Right now the
 *	    only argument is the current page number, and actually nothing of any
 *	    importance is currently done.
 *
 *	setdecoding
 *
 *	  num setdecoding -
 *
 *	    Selects the text decoding procedure (ie. what's assigned to PostScript
 *	    procedure t) from the decodingdefs array defined in the prologue. num
 *	    should be the value assigned to variable encoding (in dpost) and will
 *	    remain constant throughout a job, unless special features, like reverse
 *	    video printing, are requested. The text encoding scheme can be set on
 *	    the command line using the -e option. Print time and the size of the
 *	    output file will usually decrease as the value assigned to encoding
 *	    increases.
 *
 *	f
 *
 *	  size font f -
 *
 *	    Selects the size and font to be used for character imaging. Font names
 *	    are defined, in *prologue, so they agree with the one or two character
 *	    names used by troff.
 *
 *	m
 *
 *	  x y m -
 *
 *	    Moves to point (x, y). Normally only used when the vertical position
 *	    changes. Horizontal positioning between words (or letters) is handled
 *	    in procedure t (below).
 *
 *	t
 *
 *	  mark text t mark
 *
 *	    Processes everything on the stack, up to the mark, as a single line
 *	    of text to be printed at a fixed vertical position. What's put out as
 *	    text depends on the encoding scheme. Setting encoding to 0 produces
 *	    output essentially identical to the original version of dpost. In that
 *	    case everything on the stack, up to a mark, is interpreted (from top
 *	    down) as an absolute horizontal position and a string to be printed at
 *	    that point. For example the stack might look like,
 *
 *		mark(this)1000(is)1100(an)1200(example)1300 t
 *
 *	    Procedure t would go through the stack, up to the mark, adjusting the
 *	    horizontal position before printing each string. In other encoding
 *	    schemes, like the one based on widthshow, strings containing several
 *	    space separated words would appear on the stack, and each one would be
 *	    preceeded by a number that's expected to be added to the width of a
 *	    space. For example we might have,
 *
 *		mark(an example)30(this is)40 2 1000 2000 t
 *
 *	    where (1000, 2000) is where the first string starts and 2 is the repeat
 *	    count (ie. number of string and space pairs on the stack).
 *
 *	w
 *
 *	  string x y w -
 *
 *	    Prints a single word starting at position (x, y). Only used in the more
 *	    complicated encoding schemes (eg. the ones based on widthshow).
 *
 *	done
 *
 *	    Makes sure the last page is printed. Only needed when we're printing
 *	    more than one page on each sheet of paper.
 *
 * The PostScript procedures that support troff's drawing commands have been moved
 * out of *prologue and put in a separate file (ie. DRAW as defined in path.h).
 * The procedures are used by the routines in file draw.c, and are copied to the
 * output file at most once and only when needed. Yet another convenient violation
 * of page independence. If you don't approve append *drawfile to *prologue and
 * make sure *drawfile can't be read when DPOST runs.
 *
 * Many default values, like the magnification and orientation, are defined in 
 * the prologue, which is where they belong. If they're changed (by options), an
 * appropriate definition is made after the prologue is added to the output file.
 * The -P option passes arbitrary PostScript through to the output file. Among
 * other things it can be used to set (or change) values that can't be accessed by
 * other options.
 *
 *
 * output language from troff:
 * all numbers are character strings
 * 
 * sn	size in points
 * fn	font as number from 1-n
 * cx	ascii character x
 * Cxyz	funny char xyz. terminated by white space
 * Hn	go to absolute horizontal position n
 * Vn	go to absolute vertical position n (down is positive)
 * hn	go n units horizontally (relative)
 * vn	ditto vertically
 * nnc	move right nn, then print c (exactly 2 digits!)
 * 		(this wart is an optimization that shrinks output file size
 * 		 about 35% and run-time about 15% while preserving ascii-ness)
 * Dt ...\n	draw operation 't':
 * 	Dl x y		line from here by x,y
 * 	Dc d		circle of diameter d with left side here
 * 	De x y		ellipse of axes x,y with left side here
 *	Da x1 y1 x2 y2	arc counter-clockwise from current point (x, y) to
 *			(x + x1 + x2, y + y1 + y2)
 * 	D~ x y x y ...	wiggly line by x,y then x,y ...
 * nb a	end of line (information only -- no action needed)
 * 	b = space before line, a = after
 * p	new page begins -- set v to 0
 * #...\n	comment
 * x ...\n	device control functions:
 * 	x i	init
 * 	x T s	name of device is s
 * 	x r n h v	resolution is n/inch
 * 		h = min horizontal motion, v = min vert
 * 	x p	pause (can restart)
 * 	x s	stop -- done forever
 * 	x t	generate trailer
 * 	x f n s	font position n contains font s
 * 	x H n	set character height to n
 * 	x S n	set slant to N
 * 
 * 	Subcommands like "i" are often spelled out like "init".
