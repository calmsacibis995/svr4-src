Picture inclusion and color selection macros. Reverse video is also supported
as a special case of color. tmac.pictures and tmac.color should be installed in
/usr/lib/tmac if you want to use troff's -m command line option. Otherwise you'll
have to add lines that look like,

	.so /usr/lib/macros/pictures

and,

	.so /usr/lib/macros/color

to your troff input files whenever you want to use the picture or color macros.

Porting the picture inclusion macros to mm and ms wasn't difficult, although there
are undoubtedly some surprises waiting. mm needed no changes, but there's at least
one known problem that hasn't been resolved. If you're printing a left justified
picture and filling text on the right things get messed up if you come to a heading
before the picture ends. Apparently the .H macro resets the indent (but not the
line length). The simplest fix, if you have problems, is call .EP right before the
.H macro.

Two simple changes to the ms macros are required before picture inclusion will
work (with ms). The changes, at least in our version of ms, are,

	5c5
	> .if !\\n(IK .if !\\n(IF .if !\\n(IX .if !\\n(BE .di
	---
	< .if !\\n(IK .if !\\n(IF .if !\\n(IX .if !\\n(BE .if !\\n(FT .di
	11c11
	> .if \\n(NX<=1 .if \\n(AJ=0 .ll \\n(LLu
	---
	< .if \\n(NX<=1 .if \\n(AJ=0 .if \\n(FT=0 .ll \\n(LLu

It might also be convenient to add a call to .EP in the ms .EM macro. Once you've
made the ms changes the picture inclusion and color selection macros should work
with most mm and ms documents.
