Source code for a program that translates tektronix 4014 files into PostScript.
Much of the code was borrowed from the 5620 tektronix emulator. Defocused mode
should work and code that ties lines to device space coordinates has been added
to ../postscript/posttek.ps. Helps eliminate the variation in line widths that
were often noticeable when a non-zero linewidth was selected (eg.  with the -w
option).

The graphics state line width (variable linewidth in ../postscript/posttek.ps)
has been initialized to 0, which gets you one pixel wide lines. That gives good
results on write-black engines, like the one used in the PS-800, but is lacking
on write-white printers like the PS-2400. Use the -w option or redefine linewidth
in file ../postscript/posttek.ps if you want a different line width.
