A simple program that reverses the pages in PostScript files that conform to
Adobe's Version 1.0 or Version 2.0 file structuring conventions. This version
is backwards compatible, but old versions of postreverse should not be used
with the translators supplied in this package!

postrevese also handles a small class of files that violate page independence
(eg. output from dpost) and can be used with all the translators supplied in this
package. The output can be conforming even if the input file wasn't. Again this
applies to dpost ouput because global definitions bracketed by %%BeginGlobal and
%%EndGlobal comments are moved to the setup section of the job.
