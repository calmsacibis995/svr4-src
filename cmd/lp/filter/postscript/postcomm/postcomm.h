/*
 *
 * A few special definitions used by the program that sends jobs to PostScript
 * printers. Most, if not all the testing, was done on a QMS PS-800 printer.
 *
 * POSTBEGIN, if it's not NULL, is some PostScript code that's sent to the
 * printer before any of the input files. It's not terribly important since the
 * same thing can be accomplished in other ways, but it is convenient. POSTBEGIN
 * is initialized so as to disable job timeouts. The string can also be set on
 * the command line using the -P option.
 *
 */


#define POSTBEGIN	"statusdict /waittimeout 0 put\n"


/*
 *
 * Status lines returned by the printer usually look like,
 *
 *
 *	%%[ status: idle; source serial 25 ]%%
 *	%%[ status: waiting; source serial 25 ]%%
 *	%%[ status: initializing; source serial 25 ]%%
 *	%%[ status: busy; source serial 25 ]%%
 *	%%[ status: printing; source serial 25 ]%%
 *	%%[ status: PrinterError: out of paper; source serial 25 ]%%
 *	%%[ status: PrinterError: no paper tray; source serial 25 ]%%
 *
 *
 * although the list isn't meant to be complete.
 *
 * The following constants are used to classify some of the different printer
 * states. readline() reads status lines from ttyi and converts everything to
 * lower case. getstatus() interprets the text that readline() stores in sbuf[]
 * and returns integer codes that classify the printer status. Those codes are
 * used in routines start(), send(), and done() to figure out what's happening
 * and what should be done next.
