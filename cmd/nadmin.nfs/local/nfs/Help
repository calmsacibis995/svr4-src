unshare:TITLE:Terminates Automatic-Current Sharing of a Resource via NFS

	Choose "read-only" if you want the resource to be
	readable but not modifiable by NFS clients.

	Choose "read/write" if you want the resource to be
	readable and modifiable.

modify:rootclients:
	Adjust the list of clients that you
	want to have root access to the
	directory.
	Each name must be one of the following:
		system
		system.domain
		netgroup ( if Yellow Pages is installed)
		"all"

	If you do not specify any clients for read-only
	or read-write access, then all clients that can
	connect to your system will have read-write access
	to the directory.  If you specify "all"
	in this step, then all clients will have
	root access.

modify:roclients:
	Adjust the list of clients that you
	want to have read-only access to the
	directory.
	Each name must be one of the following:
		system
		system.domain
		netgroup ( if Yellow Pages is installed)
		"all"

	If you do not specify any clients for read-only
	or read-write access, then all clients that can
	connect to your system will have read-write access
	to the directory.  If you specify that "all"
	clients that can connect to your system will
	may have read-write access, then you may still
	exclude particular clients by specifying them
	as read-write access in the previous step.

modify:rwclients:
	Adjust the list of clients that you
	want to have read-write access to the
	directory.
	Each name must be one of the following:
		system
		system.domain
		netgroup ( if Yellow Pages is installed)
		"all"

	If you do not specify any clients for read-only
	or read-write access, then all clients that can
	connect to your system will have read-write access
	to the directory.  If you specify that "all"
	clients that can connect to your system will
	may have read-write access, then you may still
	exclude particular clients by specifying them
	as read-only clients in the next step.

share:auth:
	Choose "secure" if you want NFS to user
	a more secure mechanism for verifying the
	identities of users of the resource.
	
list:auto:
	Choose "yes" to see the local resources
	that are shared automatically when the Network
	File System server operations begin.

modify:auto:
	Choose "yes" to modify how the resource is shared automatically when
	Network File System service begins.
	
share:auto:
	Choose "yes" to share a local resource
	automatically when Network File System
		service begins.
	
share2:rootclient:
	Enter the name of a client system that you
	want to have root access to the directory.
	This name must be one of the following:
	
		a system
		a netgroup(if available via Yellow Pages)
		"all"     (allows all systems to have read-only access)

	If you do not specify any clients for
	root access, then no client will have root access
	to the directory.
	If you specify "all" in this step, then all clients will have
	root access.

share2:roclient:
	Enter the name of a client system that you
	want to have read-only access to the directory.
	This name must be one of the following:

		a system
		a netgroup(if available via Yellow Pages)
		"all"     (allows all systems to have read-only access)

	If you do not specify any clients for read-write or
	read-only access, then all clients that can connect
	to your system will have read/write access to the directory.
	If you specify "all" in this step, then all clients will have
	read-only access, except those explicitly given read/write
	access in the previous step.

share2:rwclient:
	Enter the name of a client system that you
	want to have read-write access to the directory.
	This name must be one of the following:

		a system
		a netgroup(if available via Yellow Pages)
		"all"     (allows all systems to have read/write access)

	If you do not specify any clients for read/write or
	read-only access, then all clients that can connect
	to your system will have read/write access to the directory.
	If you specify that "all" clients may have read/write 
	access, then you may still exclude particular clients by
	specifying them as read-only clients in the next step.

list:curr:
	Choose "yes" to see the local resources
	that are currently shared.

modify:curr:
	Choose "yes" to modify immediately how
	the local resource is currently shared.
	
modify:directory:
	Enter the pathname of a directory on the
	local system that is currently or
	automatically shared via NFS.
	
share:directory:
	Enter the full pathname of the local directory
	that you want to share.
	
modify:id:
	Enter the user ID number that you want to be
	assigned to unknown users who attempt to use the
	resource.  If you do not specify a number, then
	the default value (-2) will be chosem.

share:id:
	Enter the numeric user id (uid) that you
	want unknown users to run under on your
	system.

share:imm:
	Choose "yes" to share a local resource
	immediately.

modify:auth:
	Choose "secure" if you want NFS to use
	a more secure mechanism for verifying the
	identities of users of the resource.
	
unshare:directory:
	Enter the pathname of a directory
	on the local sysem that is currently shared
	or in the automatic sharing list.

unshare:imm:
	Choose "yes" to unshare the resource immediately.

unshare:auto:
	Choose "yes" to terminate the automatic
	sharing of the resource when Network File
	System service begins.

unshar2:ok:
	Choose whether the resource displayed shall
	no longer be shared automatically by the
	Network File System.

unshar3:ok:
	choose "yes" to make the resource displayed
	no longer available to remote systems by the
	Network File System.

modify:id:
	Enter the user ID number that you want to be
	assigned to unknown users who attempt to use the
	resource.  If you do not specify a number, then
	the default value (-2) will be chosen.

modify:auth:
	Choose "secure" if you want NFS to use
	a more secure mechanism for verifying the
	identities of users of the resource.


modify3:ok:
	Answer "yes" if you want to make the
	changes you have just specified for how
	remote systems can begin accessing this
	directory via the Network File System.
	Automatic sharing of the directory with
	remote systems will not be affected.
