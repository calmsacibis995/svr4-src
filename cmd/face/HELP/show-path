The show-path command enables you to display the entire pathname of any
object currently displayed in a file folder.  It is possible that an
object will occur in a file folder whose name is too long to display
completely on your terminal.  To find out the full name of this object,
use the show-path command.

Use one of the methods below to use show-path on an object. The object
must be the currently active object on your display since the show-path
command takes no arguments.

     Command Menu:  Select show-path and press ENTER.

     Command Menu:  Press CTRL-j with cursor on show-path and an -->
     (alternative)  will appear on the command line followed by the
                    show-path. Press ENTER to execute the command.

     Command Line:  Type show-path and press ENTER.
