The find command enables you to search for objects in your system
based on any or all of the following criteria: Name of the file or
file folder; Object type; Owner; Age.

Find will search down through all file folders from the point you are 
at in the Filecabinet.  If you issue the find from the Filecabinet,
the Filecabinet is searched.  You can also specify via the "command
line" method the name of a file folder to be searched.

Use one of the methods below for the find command:

     Command Menu:  Select find and press ENTER.

     Command Menu:  Press CTRL-j with cursor on find and an -->
     (alternative)  will appear on the command line followed by the
                    find. Type arguments and press ENTER to execute
                    the command.

     Command Line:  Type find [object] [file folder name] and press
                    ENTER.

   1.  If you specified an object name, FACE will begin the search
       for matches.

   2.  If you did not specify an object, a form titled
       "Find <user login>" will appear requesting that you specify the
       search criteria.

     3.  When the find is complete, an "Objects Found" menu frame will
         be  displayed listing  all matches found.  Each object in the
         menu is specified in its "path name" format so you will know
         what file folder actually contains the object.
