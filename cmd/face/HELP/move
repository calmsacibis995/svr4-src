The move command enables you to move a selected file or file folder to
another file folder.  "Object" is the object to be moved and the
"file folder name" is the file folder in which the object is to be
placed.

Use one of the methods below to move an object. The object moved will
be the current object if the object name is not specified with the
move command.

     Function Key:  Press the CHG-KEYS function key, then MOVE.

     Command Menu:  Select move and press ENTER.

     Command Menu:  Press CTRL-j with cursor on move and an -->
     (alternative)  will appear on the command line followed by the
                    move. Type arguments and press ENTER to
                    execute the command.

     Command Line:  Type move [object] [file folder name] and press
                    ENTER.

  1.  A message will appear if you did not specify a destination
      file folder with the move command.

           Open or navigate to the destination folder and press SELECT.

      Navigate to the destination file folder. Open it if it is not
      currently open, and press SELECT. To cancel the move command, 
      press the CANCEL function key.

  2.  If a file with the same name as the one you are moving
      already exists in the destination file folder, you will be
      prompted for a new name.

To move an entire file folder to another file folder, specify the
file folder name as the object to be moved.
