Press CHOICES to select the login name or type the login name
(user name) of the user who will "own" the object.

Only the owner can change the owner of a file or file folder.
Normally, all objects in your Filecabinet are owned by you.

WARNING: If you change read, write, or run/search permissions for a
file or file folder, then you change the owner to a user other than
yourself, you might not have access to it.
