The delete command enables you to remove objects (files and file
folders) from the system.  Objects deleted will be placed in your
WASTEBASKET for a time period you specify on the "Office Functions"
form accessed from the Preferences menu.  Objects deleted from the
WASTEBASKET are removed from the system. (Mail messages are not placed
in the WASTEBASKET.)

Use one of the methods below to delete an object. The object deleted
will be the currently active object if the object name is not
specified with the delete command. If the object is a file folder, it
will not be deleted if any file or file folder in it is open.
