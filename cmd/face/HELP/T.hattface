The AT&T FACE Menu is your entry point into FACE. When you log in, the
AT&T FACE Menu is your active frame.  It serves as a starting point
for accessing all parts of FACE. It is always present on the screen.

If this is your first time using AT&T FACE, you should get help on
the mechanics of using it by striking F8, CONTENTS, before continuing.

The items on the AT&T FACE Menu are:

      Office of <your login>:  Enables you to create, organize, and 
      access your Filecabinet, access the Filecabinets of other 
      users, and customize certain aspects of AT&T FACE.

      Printer Operations: Presents you with a menu that allows you
      to get printer status information and printer queue information
      for all of the printers defined on your machine.

      Programs:  Gives you access to special applications which
      have either been installed by your system administrator or
      added to the programs menu by you.  Examples of special
      applications may include spreadsheets, editors, word
      processors or other popular software packages.

      System Administration:  Presents you with menus and forms for
      doing System Administration tasks.  This menu item only appears
      if you were given permission for this operation by your System
      Administrator.

      UNIX System:  Places you directly at the UNIX System prompt.
      This menu items only appears if you were given permission 
      for this operation by your System Administrator.

      Exit FACE:  Exits from AT&T FACE and, if AT&T FACE was invoked
      for you automatically when you logged in, it logs you off.
