The  frm-mgmt command enables you to move and reshape frames.  It also
supports a "list" function that lists all open frames on the screen.

Use one of the methods below to use the frm-mgmt command. The
currently active frame is assumed if the frame number is not specified
with the frm-mgmt command.

     Command Menu:  Select frm-mgmt and press ENTER.

     Command Menu:  Press CTRL-j with cursor on frm-mgmt and an -->
     (alternative)  will appear on the command line followed by the
                    frm-mgmt.  Type arguments and press ENTER to
                    execute the command.
     Command Line:  Type frm-mgmt [operation] [frame # ] and press
                    ENTER.

If an "operation" is not specified,  a pop-up menu frame titled "Frame
Management" will appear listing the frm-mgmt operations.
