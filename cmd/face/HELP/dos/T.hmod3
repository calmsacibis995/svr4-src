Enter the full pathname and drive number of the program to execute
when this menu item is selected from the Programs menu.  The drive
number is mandatory.  Use slashes instead of backslashes to seperate
the names in the path.

For example:
     d:/test/program   is valid but
     d:\test\program   is not.

WARNING: Only the format of this field is validated.  No check is
         performed to verify that you have indeed specified the
         name of an actual working program.

The default is the program name for the program you are modifying.
