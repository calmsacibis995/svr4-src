The Remove MS-DOS Programs Menu allows you to remove MS-DOS programs 
that you have added to the Programs Menu in your office.

Each item on the menu represents a personal MS-DOS program that 
you have installed in your office.

Once you have selected an MS-DOS program from the menu, a confirmation
window will be displayed.  If you press the CONT function key, the
MS-DOS program will be deleted.  If you press the CANCEL function key,
the MS-DOS program will NOT be deleted.
