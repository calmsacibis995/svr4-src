The Modify MS-DOS Programs Menu allows you to modify MS-DOS programs 
that you have added to your personal Programs Menu in your office.

Each item on the menu represents a personal MS-DOS program that 
you have installed in your office.

Once you have chosen an MS-DOS program from the menu, a form is
displayed that allows you to modify the selected MS-DOS program.
