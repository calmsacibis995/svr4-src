Striking the HELP function key (f1) (or typing CTRL-j help or
CTRL-f 1) will display a frame of help text for an entire menu, a
single field on a form, or a command.

HELP for a menu describes the menu, each menu item, and the associated
tasks and sub-menus. It will inform you of tasks that should have been
completed prior to invoking the menu and will describe error
conditions that could occur.  

HELP for forms provides details for the field your cursor is resting
on.  It describes the input for the field and what the information is 
used for.

In addition HELP on menus and form fields, you can receive help on
each FACE command on the Commands Menu. You can either press the HELP
function key with the cursor resting on a command in the Commands Menu
or you can type help [command name] on the command line. Help for a
command describes the function, syntax, and use of the command.  Also,
you are instructed on how to complete any prompts that are part of
the command procedure.

When the active frame is a HELP frame, function key (f8) changes to
CONTENTS.  When you press CONTENTS, a menu for the Overview of AT&T
FACE Contents  will be displayed.  Striking ENTER on any item in the
menu will provide tutorial-type information on the AT&T FACE interface.

To close a HELP frame, press the CANCEL function key.
