The copy command enables you to duplicate a selected object (file or
file folder) keeping one copy in its original location and moving the
other to a new location.  "Object" is the object to be copied and the
"file folder name" is the file folder where the copy is to be placed.
FACE will prompt you for any information you don't provide on the
command line.

Use one of the methods below to copy an object. The currently active
object will be copied if the object is not specified with the copy
command.

     Function Key:  Press the CHG-KEYS function key, then COPY.

     Command Menu:  Select copy and press ENTER.

     Command Menu:  Press CTRL-j with cursor on copy and an -->
     (alternative)  will appear on the command line followed by the
                    copy. Type arguments and press ENTER to
                    execute the command.

     Command Line:  Type copy [object] [file folder name] and press
     ENTER.

   1.  The following message and prompt will appear if you did not
       specify a destination file folder with the copy command:

            Open or move to the destination folder and press SELECT.

       Navigate to the destination file folder, opening it if it is
       not currently open, and press SELECT.  If you would like to
       copy the object to the currently active file folder, press
       SELECT. Striking the CANCEL function key will cancel the copy.

   2.  If a file with the same name already exists in the destination
       file folder, you will be prompted for a new name for the copy.

To copy an entire file folder to another file folder, specify the
file folder name as the object to be copied.
