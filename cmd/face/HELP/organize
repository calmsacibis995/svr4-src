The organize command enables you to change the presentation of objects
in a file folder. This pertains to an individual file or file folder.
On the "Office Functions" frame, you can specify a presentation style
for all your files and file folders.  If you use the organize command
to organize a file folder, then globally define folder presentation
through "Office Functions", the presentation specified with organize
will take precedence.
