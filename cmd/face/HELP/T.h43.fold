File folder objects are the containers for your files.  Just as a
regular office uses filecabinets, folders and files, AT&T FACE uses the
same objects.

Your Filecabinet is a file folder that is synonymous with your 
HOME directory.

A file folder is a named object that contains one or more files and
other folders.  File folders can be created, deleted, redescribed, or
renamed, by using keyboard keys or commands.  Deleting a folder will
also delete any objects contained within it.

You can change the way objects in a file folder are displayed 
(order of presentation and amount of information) by using the 
organize command for an individual file folder, or by using 
Preferences options for your entire Filecabinet and Wastebasket.

By using File Permissions under Preferences you may control who has 
access to your files and file folders. This allows you to determine 
who has read, write, and run/search permissions for yourself, your group
and anyone with access to the system.
