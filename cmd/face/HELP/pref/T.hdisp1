This is the first of up to four frames that you can specify to be
automatically displayed when you login to FACE.

Only menus or file folders should be specified.  Forms should not
be specified because most require input that will not be available
if forms are opened out of sequence.

Press CHOICES to select the frame or enter the pathname including
the file folder to specify a frame that is not on the menu.  If
you enter an invalid pathname, you will be warned.

If you specify a frame that has already been specified as the
second, third, or fourth frame, you will be warned.

If no frames are specified on the Display Frames Form, the system
will automatically display only the AT&T FACE Menu at invocation.
