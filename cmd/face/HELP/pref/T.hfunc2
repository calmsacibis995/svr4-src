Press CHOICES to toggle between Yes and No to specify whether you
wish a prompt to appear when you login to notify you that objects in
the WASTEBASKET are ready for deletion.

If you set this option to "No", the prompt will not appear and files
and file folders will be deleted as scheduled in "Delete objects after
# of days" field, without an opportunity for you to retrieve them.

The default choice is "yes".
