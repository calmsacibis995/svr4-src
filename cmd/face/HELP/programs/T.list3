The Remove Programs Menu allows you to remove programs 
that you have added to your personal Programs Menu in
your office.

Each item on the menu represents a personal program that 
you have installed in your office.

Once you have selected a program from the menu, a confirmation
window will be displayed.  If you press the CONT function 
key, the program will be deleted.  If you press the CANCEL
function key, the program will NOT be deleted.
