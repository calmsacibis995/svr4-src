The Modify Programs Menu allows you to modify programs 
that you have added to your personal Programs Menu in
your office.

Each item on the menu represents a personal program that 
you have installed in your office.

Once you have chosen a program from the menu, a form is
displayed that allows you to modify the selected program.
