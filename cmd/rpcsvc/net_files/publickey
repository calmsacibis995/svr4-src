# Public Key Database
#
# To add an entry to this file, an administrator should use the command 
# "newkey" on the server (YP master) machine.
#
# YP: Users can also insert their own entries into this file using the chkey
# command. Commenting out the "nobody" entry below disallows this feature,
# and chkey will only allow users to change their existing entry, not create
# a new one.
