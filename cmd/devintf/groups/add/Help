add:ABSTRACT:
	The "add" task adds a device group definition to the Device Management 
	tables.  You will be asked to supply a device group name and the 
	devices that are to be members of the device group.

Form.add:Name:the Group Name field
	This field names the group that is to be added to the list of device
	groups.
	
	The group name must contain only alphanumeric characters and the 
	characters '.', '-', '_', and '$'.  It may not be longer than 14 
	characters.  This field may not be blank.

Form.add:Member:the Membership fields
	These fields name the device aliases that are to be members of the group
	being added.  If an alias is specified that is not currently defined, 
	the task will issue a warning message but accept the alias as a member.
	
	The aliases must be valid aliases (i.e. they contain only alphanumeric
	characters and the characters '.', '-', '_', and '$' and contain no more
	than 14 characters).  These fields may be blank.
