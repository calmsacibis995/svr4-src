ABSTRACT:
	The "Add Storage Device" task interactively defines the
	software configuration for a particular device. It can
	be used to configure the 2nd integral disk, a SCSI device,
	or other hardware that requires software configuration.
	
	It supports configuration of an empty (new) or reconfiguration
	of non-empty (existing) storage device.  It operates in
	conjunction with aliases stored in /etc/device.tab that
	have the "addcmd" attribute defined.  The "addcmd" attribute
	must contain a valid path name that coincides with the command
	to be run which performs the configuration.
	
	The hardware must be present before this task is invoked.
	Some hardware devices such as the integral cartridge tape
	do not require you to invoke this task.
	
	WARNING\: Reconfiguration may overwrite all data on the device.

devnm:Device Name
	Enter the name of the device you wish to set-up.
	Press CHOICES for a list of valid device names.

nodev:Add Storage Device
	The /etc/device.tab file does not contain any entries
	with the 'addcmd' attribute. This attribute is used to
	identify the presence of configurable devices.
	
	Please review the device installation procedures and try again.
