# This directory is required to maintain pre-SVR4 compatibility
# between the 4.0 OA&M and preSVR4 FACE style add-on packages.
#
# Add-ons which include preSVR4 FACE type Forms and Menus install via
# installpkg(1M) and cpio(1). The Forms, Menus and Text files all install
# relative to /usr/vmsys for preSVR4 releases. Some packages update menus
# via shells as opposed to menu_add/menu_del. In addition, OPEN directives
# are sometimes issued via the $VMSYS environment variable and other times
# are hard coded into the Forms/Menus/Text files. Since we wish to support
# the installation and function of preSVR4 user interfaces that are not being
# re-released in 4.0, we are required to maintain the /usr/vmsys directory
# structure into 4.0. All new and re-released packages are required to
# follow the new user interface and install/remove format.
#
# Several 3.2 top level Menu and Help files have been installed under this
# directory.  The OBJECTS directory is symbolically linked into
# /usr/sadm/sysadm/menu/<path> where <path> translates to several OAM
# directories requiring backwards compatibility. This will allow
# allow existing add-on packages to install and modify the top-level Menus
# as they did pre SVR4. Each of the top level 4.0 menu items have a
# corresponding menu entry. These entries are identified via the express
# mode keyword string "preSVR4".
#
# The object generator (/usr/sadm/sysadm/bin/object_gen) recognizes "preSVR4"
# as a special case and expands the cooresponding menu item in-line with
# the menu being generated. The description field becomes the title for the
# corresponding menu. The menu title matches the pre-SVR4 instance.
#
# In some cases, the preSVR4 keyword has a space character pad at the end
# of the string for the .menu files.  In these cases, the in-line expansion
# does not occur. This was done in order to post warning frames informing
# the user that they are entering the preSVR4 realm with a pointer to the
# corresponding 4.0 menu items.
#
# If you install a preSVR4 package with interface scripts, and those scripts
# are not accessible through OA&M, add an entry of the form:
#
#	preSVR4^<your description>^OBJECTS/....
#  ( where "...." completes the pathname to your top level Menu entry )
#
# within the object_gen type OA&M menu that you would like to access your
# application through. Next, type:
# 		ln -s /usr/vmsys/OBJECTS OBJECTS
# within the same directory. This will link you into the preSVR4 structure.
# Finally, add a menu entry within the OBJECTS/.... file. In most cases,
# this was already performed for you by the add-on application at install
# time. When you enter # the appropriate directory within sysadm, your 3.2
# entry should expand in-line along with any/all 4.0 entries.
#
# We suggest that you link into preSVR4 menus from within "applications"
# but the strategy will work for any existing OA&M object_gen menu files.
# 
# It is worth mentioning that if you install an item within a menu file
# that is part of the "extended" interface and the "extended" interface
# is removed, your interface will not be accessible via OA&M until extended
# is re-installed. For the cases where you've manually added a "preSVR4"
# menu entry, you may additionally need to recreate this entry. Aside from
# this fact, removing and then re-installing any part of OA&M will not affect
# your ability to access your application interface.
