The Backup to Removable Media Menu lets you make a floppy disk or
cartridge tape copy of the files you have on your computer's hard
disk.

You can back up all files (system and user), only the files updated
since the last backup, an individual user's files, or selected
files/directories.

When copying to floppy, be sure to have several formatted floppy
disks, depending on the amount of information you have on your system.

The items on the Backup to Removable Media Menu are:

      Backup History:  Displays the date and time of the last
      system backup and incremental backup.

      Personal Backup:  Performs a backup of all files or selected
      files in your HOME directory.

      Schedule System Backup:  You can schedule, ahead of time, a
      system backup and/or incremental system backup. Also, you can
      delete a previously scheduled backup request or show a list of
      currently scheduled backups. Adding, changing, or deleting a
      backup request requires system administration privileges.

      System Backup:  You can backup all system and user files that
      have been modified or created since your system was installed.
      You must have system administration privileges to do this.
