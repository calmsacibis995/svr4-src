The Select Removable Media Menu allows you to select the appropriate
disk drive or the cartridge type drive for storing your data. 

The floppy disks used for backup must be formatted in UNIX System
format. Tapes do not have to be formatted.

Your system will calculate the number of floppies/tapes needed for
backup and the time required and prompt you to insert additional
floppies if necessary.  Follow the instructions on your screen to
insert floppies or tapes.
