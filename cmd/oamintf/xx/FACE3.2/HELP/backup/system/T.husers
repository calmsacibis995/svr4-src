The Backup Users Menu allows you to select "all" or specific login
names from a list.

Move to the login name with the arrow keys and strike the MARK 
function key.  When you have finished selecting login names to 
backup, strike ENTER.

All files in the user's $HOME directory will be backed up. You need
system administration privileges to back up other user's files.
