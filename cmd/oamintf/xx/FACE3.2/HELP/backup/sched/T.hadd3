Strike CHOICES to display the days. You may select one day, a
combination of days, or "all" days.

Move to the day(s) desired with the arrow keys, then strike the MARK
function key. When your selection is completed, strike ENTER.

You can indicate a series of days by typing the first day
and last day separated by a "-".  For example, 17 - 24 would schedule
the backup for the 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 24th.
