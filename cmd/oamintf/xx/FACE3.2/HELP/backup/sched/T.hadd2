Strike CHOICES to display the months. You may select one month, a
combination of months, or "all" months.

Move to the month(s) desired with the arrow keys, then strike the MARK
function key. When your selection is completed, strike ENTER.

You can indicate a series of months by typing the first month
and last month separated by a "-".  For example, 1 - 6 would schedule
the backup for January, February, March, April, May, and June.
