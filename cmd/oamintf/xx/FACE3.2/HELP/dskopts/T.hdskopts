The Disk Operations Menu enables you to format floppy disks and copy
important information from one floppy disk to another.

The items on the Disk Operations Menu are:

      Floppy to Floppy Copy:  Before you begin, make sure that your
      destination floppy has been formatted and does not have a
      write-protect tab. Be sure that it does not contain any
      information you wish to keep because existing information will
      be overwritten.  When "Floppy To Floppy Copy" is selected, the
      system prompts you through the procedure.  If you two floppy
      disk drives you will be asked to specify the source drive and 
      destination drive.  When the copy is completed, the system 
      will allow you to make additional copies.

         CAUTION: It is recommended that the source and destination
         floppies be the same density. It is possible to copy a smaller
         floppy to a larger floppy without any problems. If you try
         to copy a larger floppy, you will risk running out of space
         on the smaller floppy.
