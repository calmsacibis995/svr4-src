The Restore From Removable Media Menu enables you to restore files to
your hard disk that were backed up to removable media. You can restore
files from your HOME directory as well as system files that were
backed up. You must have system administration privileges to perform
a system restore.

The items on the Restore From Removable Media Menu are:

      Personal Restore:  You can restore all of your own files
      (directories or regular files) or selectively restore particular
      files that were backed up from your HOME directory.

      System Restore:  You can restore all files or selectively
      restore specific files that were backed up.  You can do a
      restore from system backup, do a selective system restore, or
      restore other user files. You must have system administration
      privileges to do this.
