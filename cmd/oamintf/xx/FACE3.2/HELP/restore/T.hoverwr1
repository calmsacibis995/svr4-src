Strike CHOICES to toggle between Yes and No.

The default is No.  

If you choose Yes, all files on the floppy disk or tape will be
transferred to your file system overwriting any files with the same
name regardless of whether the file on the hard disk is newer than
the one on the removable media. If you choose No, files on the hard
disk that are newer (i.e., modified after the backup was done) will
not be overwritten.
