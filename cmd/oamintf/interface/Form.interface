`$OAMBASE/bin/object_gen $ARG1 $ARG2`

#
#  This file is the object specified within generated FMLI objects
#  by the object generator (object_gen) when it determines that a form
#  object will be generated.
#
#  The line `object_gen $ARG1 $ARG2` is a backquoted expression
#  that FMLI expands and causes it to execute the program "object_gen",
#  (the object generator) with the two arguments $ARG1 and $ARG2.
#  Both variables are expanded by FMLI.  ARG1 is the directory location
#  of the form object to be generated and ARG2 is the name of the form object.
#
#  The contents of this file are identical to those of "Text.interface" and
#  "Menu.interface".  However three files must exist (one for Menu, Form and 
#  Text) because FMLI looks at the filename syntax before determining what type
#  of object it is working with.
