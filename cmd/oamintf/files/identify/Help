ABSTRACT:
	Identify is a heuristic task that will try to determine the
	type of any unmounted file system without damaging the data 
	or the medium of the file system. 
	
	Serious data damage can occur if an attempt is made to mount
	or repair a file system with the wrong type designated.

	The heuristics may take several moments before the file 
	system type is determined.
TITLE:Identify the type of Unmounted File Systems
Form.identify:F1:Device name of the file system to be identified:
	Devices that contain file systems are usually partitions on
	the hard disk. For example the partition /dev/dsk/1s3 is
	the fourth partition on the second (numbering from zero) hard
	disk.  Among other devices which can contain file systems
	floppy diskette drives are the most common. 
	
	Devices can be accessed via either of block or character
	interfaces. The block interface to the device causes data
	on the device to be accessed in a buffered manner. The 
	character interface provides character input/output to the 
	device. For example buffered I/O can be performed on a floppy 
	device by specifying the block interface "/dev/dsk/f0t"
	and character I/O can be performed by specifying "/dev/rdsk/f0t"
	which is the character interface to this device.

identifytask:
	The file system in question has been identified. For more
	information, type [CANCEL] two times to return to the
	preceding form, and then type [HELP].
