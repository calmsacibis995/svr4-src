ABSTRACT:
	These menus allow you to add, display, modify or remove
	entries in the defaults table (/etc/vfstab). These 
	defaults may subsequently be used by file system 
	checking and mounting operations at the boot time and
	other file system related administrative tasks.
add:ABSTRACT:
	This task adds defaults for a file system. Those defaults
	may subsequently be used by other tasks requiring such 
	information and check and mount operations at boot time.
display:ABSTRACT:
	This task displays defaults for a file system. Those 
	defaults may subsequently be used by check and mount
	operations at boot time.
modify:ABSTRACT:
	This task modifies defaults for a file system. Those
	defaults may subsequently be used by check and mount 
	operations at boot.
remove:ABSTRACT:
	This task removes defaults for a file system from the 
	default table. Once removed such file systems will no
	longer be automatically checked and mounted at boot.

Form.add:TITLE:Add Defaults for File Systems
Form.add:F1:Device that contains the file system:
	Devices that contain file systems are usually partitions on
	the hard disk. For example the partition /dev/dsk/1s3 is
	the fourth partition on the second (numbering from zero) hard
	disk.  Among other devices which can contain file systems floppy
	diskette drives are the most common. 
	
	Devices can be accessed via either of block or character
	interfaces. The block interface to the device causes data
	on the device to be accessed in a buffered manner. The 
	character interface provides character input/output to the 
	device. For example buffered I/O can be performed on a floppy 
	device by specifying the block interface "/dev/dsk/f0t"
	and character I/O can be performed by specifying "/dev/rdsk/f0t"
	which is the character interface to this device.

Form.add:F2:File system name when mounted:
	The Unix system provides the capability to add or remove 
	file systems which are stored on hardware devices such as
	hard disks and diskettes via the processes of mounting and 
	unmounting. File systems are added by mounting the device
	that contains the file system at a leaf directory on the 
	system. This leaf directory is known as the mount point for 
	file system and becomes the root of the newly mounted 
	file system when the mount is successful. 

	For example if the diskette (/dev/dsk/f0t) is mounted on
	the mount-point "/mnt" then the file system name of the 
	newly added file system is "/mnt".

Form.add2:F1:Should the file system be automatically mounted at boot:
	A "yes" reply to this prompt will set up your system in
	such a way that this file system will automatically be
	checked and made available each time you reboot the 
	system.  Type a "no" reply at this prompt if you intend to  
	manually check and mount the file system each time the 
	system is rebooted.

Form.add2:F2:File System type:
	The Unix system provides file systems of different types.
	Different file system types provide different functionalities
	for different applications. Your system may have file systems 
	of one or more types. For a listing of file system types 
	available on your system use the "Display" task.

	It is very important for you to specify the correct file system
	type while performing these operations. Specifying the wrong 
	type may cause the corruption of the file system.
Form.add2:F3:Mount Options:
	File systems can be mounted in different ways depending
	on the options provided while mounting them. All file 
	systems allow you to mount them "read only" or "read/write".
	By mounting a file system "read only" you can prevent users
	from writing to the file system. Other options include the
	ability to allow and disallow "setuid" permissions on the 
	file system. 

	The following prompts will prompt you for the various 
	mount options allowed by the file system in question. 
Form.add2:F4:Read and write privileges:
	You must specify the Read and Write privileges which will
	be allowed for this file system. If the file system 
	contains sensitive data which should not be modified by
	other users the privilege used should be "read only".
	In other cases you may grant "read/write" privileges for
	this file system.
Form.add2:F5:Should setuid programs be allowed:
	By entering 'yes', 'no' or 'na' at this prompt you can 
	specify whether setuid privileges will be allowed, will
	not be allowed, or are not applicable for 
	this file system. The default is yes.
Form.display:TITLE:Display Defaults for File Systems
