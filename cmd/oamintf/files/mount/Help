ABSTRACT:
	This task supports the mounting of file systems. They
	can be mounted as read-write or read-only and with 
	setuid programs enabled or disabled. 

	File systems mounted with setuid programs disabled 
	will ignore setuid on execution. Disabling setuid programs
	is a security measure that the administrator can take.

	The file system type of the file system must be known
	and will be asked for.

Form.mount:TITLE:
Form.mount:F1:Device that contains the file system:
	Devices that contain file systems are usually partitions on
	the hard disk. For example the partition /dev/dsk/1s3 is
	the fourth partition on the second (numbering from zero) hard
	disk.  Among other devices which can contain file systems floppy 
	diskette drives are the most common. 

Form.mount:F2:File system name when mounted:
	The Unix system provides the capability to add or remove 
	file systems which are stored on hardware devices such as
	hard disks and diskettes via the processes of mounting and 
	unmounting. File systems are added by mounting the device
	that contains the file system at a leaf directory on the 
	system. This leaf directory is known as the mount point for 
	file system and becomes the root of the newly mounted 
	file system when the mount is successful. 

	For example if the diskette (/dev/dsk/f0t) is mounted on
	the mount-point "/mnt" then the file system name of the 
	newly added file system is "/mnt".

Form.mount2:F1:File System Type (IMPORTANT: DO NOT GUESS): 
	The Unix system provides file systems of different types.
	Different file system types provide different functionalities
	for different applications. Your system may have file systems 
	of one or more types. For a listing of file system types 
	available on your system use the "Display" task.

	It is very important for you to specify the correct file system
	type while performing these operations. Specifying the wrong 
	type may cause the corruption of the file system. If you are
	unsure of the file system type, type unknown at the prompt and
	the interface will run heuristics which will try and determine
	the type of the file system.
Form.mount2:F2:Mount Options:
	File systems can be mounted in different ways depending
	on the options provided while mounting them. All file 
	systems allow you to mount them "read only" or "read/write".
	By mounting a file system "read only" you can prevent users
	from writing to the file system. Other options include the
	ability to allow and disallow "setuid" permissions on the 
	file system. 

	The following prompts will prompt you for the various 
	mount options allowed by the file system in question. 
Form.mount2:F3:Read and Write Privileges:
	You must specify the Read and Write privileges which will
	be allowed for this file system. If the file system 
	contains sensitive data which should not be modified by
	other users the privilige used should be "read only".
	In other cases you may grant "read/write" privileges for
	this file system.
Form.mount2:F4:Should setuid programs be allowed:
	By entering 'yes', 'no', or 'na' at this prompt you can 
	specify whether setuid privileges will be allowed, will not
	be allowed, or are not applicable for
	this file system. The default is yes.

	File systems can be mounted in different ways depending

	systems allow you to mount them "read only" or "read/write".
	By mounting a file system "read only" you can prevent users
	from writing to the file system. Other options include the
	ability to allow and disallow "setuid" permissions on the 
	file system. 

	The following prompts will prompt you for the various 
	mount options allowed by the file system in question. 
Form.mount3:F3:Read and Write Privileges:
	You must specify the Read and Write privileges which will
	be allowed for this file system. If the file system 
	contains sensitive data which should not be modified by
	other users the privilige used should be "read only".
	In other cases you may grant "read/write" privileges for
	this file system.
Form.mount3:F4:Should setuid programs be allowed:
	By entering yes or no at this prompt you can 
	specify whether setuid privileges will be allowed
	on this file system. The default is yes.
mounttask:
	The file system requested will be checked for sanity
	prior to mounting. The check will fail if the file
	system is currently mounted or if it is the wrong
	type.
findtypetask:
	You have selected a file system type of "unknown". A
	file system type "check" was run, the results of which
	have been displayed. You must now type [CANCEL] two times,
	complete the form with this information and then type [SAVE].
