	you would like to search.  There is no default for this field.
	The directory name must be an absolute path (beginning with

	a longer time to to search directories with short names such
	as "/" or "/usr".

	enter a number, the 10 largest files in the directory will 
	be listed.

	An error occurred while attempting to get the list of files
	you asked for.  The error may be because the directory
	does not have any files in it.  You may specify a 
	different directory and number of files, or you may quit the 
	"filesize" task.

	directory you specified (where 'n' is the number you specified
	on the first "filesize" task form).
