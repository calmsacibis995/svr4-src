ABSTRACT:
	This task allows the user to store interactions with software 
	packages for later use during unattended installation.

pkgloc: Software Location
	Enter the device on which the software resides (e.g., "diskette1"
	or "9track1"), or enter the pathname to a directory where the 
	software is spooled.  To indicate the default spool directory, 
	enter "spool".

pkgid: Package Selection
	Enter the word "all" to interact with all packages which reside 
	on the device.  If you wish to interact with a specific package, 
	enter the package instance identifier (e.g., "spell" or "rfs").  
	You may enter multiple package identifiers by separating each one 
	with a comma (e.g., "spell,rfs,windowing"), but these packages
	must all be available on the same volume.  If you are not sure
	which packages you want to interact from the indicated device,
	leave this field blank and you will be prompted to select from
	the list of available packages.

rspfile: Response File Selection
	The results of interaction with a package is file which has one
	or more entries of the form
		VARIABLE=value
	These package parameters have a meaning which is defined by the
	package and is interpreted during package installation and/or
	removal.  This task stores these values in the filename which
	you provide; this file cannot already exist.  If you have chosen
	to interact with more than one package, you must provide the
	name of a directory where these response files may be created.
	In this case, they will be created with names that correspond
	to the package from which the interaction was taken.  In either
	case, this field may not be left blank.
