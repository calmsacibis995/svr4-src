ABSTRACT:
	This task removes software packages from the system or spooled
	on a device.

pkgloc: Software Location
	Enter the word "installed" to indicate that you want to remove 
	software which is currently installed on your system.  To remove 
	software which is spooled, enter the device on which the software 
	resides (e.g., "diskette1" or "9track1".)  To indicate the default 
	spool directory, enter "spool".

pkgid: Package Selection
	To remove a specific package, enter the package instance identifier
	(e.g., "spell" or "rfs").  To remove multiple package identifiers,
	separate each with a comma (e.g., "spell,rfs,windowing".)  To 
	remove all instances of a particular package, use a wildcard
	format (e.g. "dbase.*").

	WARNING:  Do NOT remove package associated with the operation of
	sysadm from within sysadm.  These include 'fmli', 'lp' and 'oam'.
	If you want to remove these packages, it is HIGHLY recommended
	that you use the 'pkgrm' command from outside of sysadm.  If you
	wish to remove all packages (which includes the packages necessary
	for sysadm to work) you can enter 'pkgrm all' from the shell
	command line.  'All' is NOT a valid choice for a package under
	remove.
