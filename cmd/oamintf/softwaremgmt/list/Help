ABSTRACT:
	This task lists information about software which is installed on
	the system or spooled on a device.

pkgloc: Software Location
	Enter the word "installed" to indicate that you want to check 
	software which is currently installed on your system.  To verify 
	software which is spooled, enter the device on which the software 
	resides (e.g., "diskette1" or "9track1".)  To indicate the default 
	spool directory, enter "spool".

pkgid: Package Selection
	Enter the word "all" to list information about all packages.  If 
	you wish to see information about a specific package, enter the 
	package instance identifier (e.g., "spell" or "rfs").  You may 
	enter multiple package identifiers by separating each one with a 
	comma (e.g., "spell,rfs,windowing".)  To display information about
	all instance of a particular package, use a wildcard format such
	as "dbase.*".

catg: Category Selection
	Each package installed on the system or residing on a spool device
	is a member of one or more software categories.  Enter a comma 
	separated list of categories (e.g., "system,application,preSVR4") 
	or the word "all" to indicate all categories.

dispopt: Display Options
	Three choices are available:  short, medium and long.  The "short"
	display lists the primary category, instance identifier and package
	name.  The "medium" display also includes package architecture and 
	version information.  The "long" display lists other information 
	such as the package installation date, and also includes a summary 
	of the types of files which are included as part of the package.
