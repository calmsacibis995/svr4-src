ABSTRACT:
	This task installs software packages onto the system.

pkgloc: Software Location
	Enter the device on which the software to be installed resides
	(e.g., "diskette1" or "9track1"), or enter the pathname to a
	directory where the software is spooled.  To indicate the default 
	spool directory, enter "spool".

pkgid: Package Selection
	Enter the word "all" to install all packages which reside on the
	installation device.  If you wish to install a specific package, 
	enter the package instance identifier (e.g., "spell" or "rfs").  
	You may enter multiple package identifiers by separating each one 
	with a comma (e.g., "spell,rfs,windowing"), but these packages
	must all be available on the same volume.  If you are not sure
	which packages you want to install from the indicated device,
	leave this field blank and you will be prompted to select from
	the list of available packages.

rspfile: Response File Selection
	Certain packages require interaction with the installer prior
	to beginning the installation process.  It is possible to use
	the "interact" task in the previous menu to store the results
	of this package interaction for use at this time.  If you have
	stored the interaction in a file, enter the pathname in this
	field.  Otherwise, leave this field blank.

dfltfile: Defaults File Selection
	As the installation service installs a package it may encounter
	several events which require the installer to decide whether or
	not to continue with installation.  This interaction is pre-
	selectable through an installation defaults file.  In this field 
	you should enter the name of the defaults file you wish to employ 
	for this installation.  Use "default" if you are unsure.
