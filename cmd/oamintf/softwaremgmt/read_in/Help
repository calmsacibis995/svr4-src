ABSTRACT:
	This task spools software packages into a directory from which
	they may later be installed.

pkgloc: Software Location
	Enter the device on which the software to be read in resides
	(e.g., "diskette1" or "9track1"), or enter the pathname to a
	directory where the software is spooled.  To indicate the default 
	spool directory, enter "spool".

pkgid: Package Selection
	Enter the word "all" to spool all packages which reside on the
	indicated device.  If you wish to spool a specific package, 
	enter the package instance identifier (e.g., "spell" or "rfs").  
	You may enter multiple package identifiers by separating each one 
	with a comma (e.g., "spell,rfs,windowing"), but these packages
	must all be available on the same volume.  If you are not sure
	which packages you want to spool from the indicated device,
	leave this field blank and you will be prompted to select from
	the list of available packages.

spool: Spool Location Selection
	Enter the directory where you wish to spool the software.
