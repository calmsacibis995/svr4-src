ABSTRACT:
	The items in the "users" menu provide functions for managing
	logins and groups on your machine.  They include the ability
	to add, modify and delete users or groups defined on your
	machine.  You can place users in groups so they can share
	access to files belonging to members of the group, but protect
	files from access by users not in the group.  In addition,
	you can set defaults that will be used for subsequent user
	definition on your machine, and you can define or redefine
	user password information.
