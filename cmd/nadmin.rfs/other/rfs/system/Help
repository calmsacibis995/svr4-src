system:add_nameserver:
	The add_nameserver task allows an administrator of the 
	primary name server of an RFS domain to add secondary name 
	servers to appropriate rfmaster files.  The RFS domain to be 
	administered must be the domain of which the local 
	system is currently a member.  If the current domain has 
	no primary name server, then the administrator may add the 
	local system as the primary name server.
	To change the current domain, choose the set_domain task
	on the systems menu.

system:add_host:
	The add_host task allows an administrator of the primary name
	server of an RFS domain to add a system to the domain
	password file.  The RFS domain to be administered must be
	the domain of which the local system is currently a member.
	To change the current domain, choose the set_domain task
	on the systems menu.

rf_add:tp:
	Choose a transport provider for which you want to specify
	name servers.

rf_add:role:
	Choose "primary" if you are starting a new
	domain or re-defining an existing domain,
	and the system being added is the local system.
	Choose "secondary" if the local system is already
	the primary name server for the current domain
	on the specified transport provider.

rf_add2:address:
	Enter the address of the name server
	that you are adding to the domain.
	This address must be the correct one for
	the transport provider specified.

	Answer "yes" if you want to start over
	in the configuration of the current domain.
	(The existing configuration will be saved
	in the rfmaster files of the subdirectories
	of /etc/dfs/rfs/transports.old.)
	Otherwise, answer "no".

system:display:
	the display_domain task allows you to display the
	name of the current RFS domain.

set:domain:
	Enter name of the RFS domain for your local
	system to join.

system:list_act_ns:
	The list_active_nsvr task allows you to list the name
	servers that are active in the current domain.  The name
	server that is active on each transport provider will
	be displayed.

system:list_hosts:
	The list_hosts task allows you to list the systems in
	the password file of the current RFS domain.

system:list_nameservers:
	The list_nameservers task lists the primary and
	secondary name servers in the current RFS domain.

system:remove_nameserver:
	The remove_namesvr task allows an administrator of the local system
	to remove systems from the local list of name servers
	for the current domain on specified transport providers.
	The primary name server should be removed only if another
	system is made the primary via the "add_nameserver"
	task on the "systems" menu before RFS is started.

p_rem:system:
	Mark the names of the systems that you
	want to remove from the domain.

system:remove_host:
	The remove task allows an administrator of the primary name
	server of an RFS domain to remove a system from the domain
	password file.  The RFS domain to be administered must be
	the domain of which the local system is currently a member.
	To change the current domain, choose the set_domain task
	on the systems menu.


system:set_domain:
	The set_domain task allows you to set the current RFS
	domain.

p_add:system:
	Enter the name of a system that you want
	to add to the domain password file.

rf_add2:system:
	Enter the name of a system that you want
	to add to the rfmaster file.

lsname:tp:
	Mark the network specification of each
	transport provider for which you want to 
	list name servers.

rf_rem:tp:
	choose a transport provider for which you
	want to remove a name server.
