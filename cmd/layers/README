set_enc.j and layersys/lsys.873 are specially cross-compiled executables
for downloading to the 5620.

The release includes a source for set_enc.j although it is not possible
to compile it without 3b2 cross-compilation tools. To allow those sites
without cross- compilation tools to create the binary from a printable
and sccsable "source", a filter (deodx.c) and hex dumps have been supplied:
	layersys/lsys.873.src
	set_enc.j.src
