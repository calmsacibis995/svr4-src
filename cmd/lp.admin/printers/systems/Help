ABSTRACT:Configure Connections to Remote Systems
	This task allows you to maintain the connections through
	which the local LP print service can exchange print requests
	with remote systems.  Through it, you are allowed to add new
	connections, list existing connections, modify existing
	connections and remove existing connections.
	
	NOTE: The actual functioning of these remote connections is
	handled by the Network Services installed on this machine.
	These remote connections MUST also be defined through Network 
	Services for this facility to function.

menu:L1:Add a New System Connection
	This task allows you to add a new remote system connection to
	the LP print service on this machine.
	
	NOTE: The actual functioning of this remote connection is
	handled by the Network Services installed on this machine.
	This remote connection MUST also be defined through Network 
	Services for this new connection to function.

menu:L2:Display Available System Connections
	This tasks allows you to display the system connections that 
	have been added to this system. It also displays a summary
	of the definition of each connection.

menu:L3:Modify a System Connection
	This task allows you to modify a connection that has already
	been added.

menu:L4:Remove a System Connection
	This task allows you to remove an existing remote connection.

add:F1:System name
	You must enter the name of a remote system that you wish to
	identify to the Print Service as an available remote system.
	This will allow you to be able to send print jobs to that
	system and receive print jobs from that system.
	
	This name should already be defined thru Network Services on
	this machine but no validation of this occurs.  The name
	entered must be less than 256 characters long.
	
	There is no default for this field.

add:F2:Scheduler type
	Select the type of LP scheduler that exists on the remote system.
	The only two valid choices are s5 (System V) or bsd (SunOS).
	
	The default for this field is s5.

add:F3:Connection timeout
	Specify the time period in minutes that the print service should
	allow a network connection to be idle.  That is, if the connection
	to the remote system is idle (ie. there is no network traffic) for
	this number of miuntes, then drop the connection.  When there is
	more work the connection will be re-established.
	
	Legal entries here are n, 0 or any integer greater than 0.  The
	value n means never timeout (ie. once established, the connection
	is never dropped).  The value 0 means as soon as the connection is
	idle, drop it.  Any other integer value is the time period in
	minutes that the connection will be allowed to remain idle before
	it is dropped.
	
	The default for this field is n.

add:F4:Retry period
	Specify the length of time, in minutes, to wait before trying to
	reestablish a connection to the remote system when the connection
	was dropped abnormally (ie. dropped through some error, not
	because you terminated it).
	
	Legal entries here are n, 0 or any integer greater than 0.  The
	value n means do not retry dropped connections until there is more
	work.  The value 0 means as soon as the connection is dropped, try
	to re-establish it.  Any other integer value is the time period in
	minutes that will pass before the connnection is re-established.
	
	The default for this field is 10.

add:F5:Comment
	Enter a comment that will be displayed along with the system entry
	when the list task is used.
	
	Any entry here must be less than 1024 characters long.
	
	There is no default for this field.

display:F1:System(s)
	You must enter the names of remote systems whose definitions
	you wish to display.  These names must already be defined as
	remote connections for the Printer Service.  If you can not
	recall the correct name, press CHOICES to display a list of
	defined systems that you may choose from.  You may also enter
	the word all to display all defined systems.
	
	The default for this field is all.

modify:F1:System name
	You must enter the name of a remote system whose definition
	you wish to modify.  This name should already be defined as
	a remote connection for Printer Service.  If you can not
	recall the correct name, press CHOICES to display a list of
	defined systems that you may choose from.
	
	There is no default for this field.

modify:F2:Scheduler type
	Select the type of LP scheduler that exists on the remote system.
	The only two valid choices are s5 (System V) or bsd (SunOS).
	
	The default for this field is the current value.

modify:F3:Connection timeout
	Specify the time period in minutes that the print service should
	allow a network connection to be idle.  That is, if the connection
	to the remote system is idle (ie. there is no network traffic) for
	this number of miuntes, then drop the connection.  When there is
	more work the connection will be re-established.
	
	Legal entries here are n, 0 or any integer greater than 0.  The
	value n means never timeout (ie. once established, the connection
	is never dropped).  The value 0 means as soon as the connection is
	idle, drop it.  Any other integer value is the time period in
	minutes that the connection will be allowed to remain idle before
	it is dropped.
	
	The default for this field is the current value.

modify:F4:Retry period
	Specify the length of time, in minutes, to wait before trying to
	reestablish a connection to the remote system when the connection
	was dropped abnormally (ie. dropped through some error, not
	because you terminated it).
	
	Legal entries here are n, 0 or any integer greater than 0.  The
	value n means do not retry dropped connections until there is more
	work.  The value 0 means as soon as the connection is dropped, try
	to re-establish it.  Any other integer value is the time period in
	minutes that will pass before the connnection is re-established.
	
	The default for this field is the current value.

modify:F5:Comment
	Enter a comment that will be displayed along with the system entry
	when the list task is used.
	
	Any entry here must be less than 1024 characters long.
	
	The default for this field is the current value.

remove:F1:System(s)
	You must enter the names of remote systems whose definitions
	you wish to remove.  These names must already be defined as
	remote connections for the Printer Service.  If you can not
	recall the correct name, press CHOICES to display a list of
	defined systems that you may choose from.
