/etc/init.d contains initialization and termination scripts
for changing init states.  These scripts are linked when appropriate
to files in the rc?.d directories.
File names in rc?.d directories are of the form [SK]nn<init.d filename>
where 'S' means start this job, 'K' means kill this job, and 'nn' is
the relative sequence number for killing or starting the job.
When entering a state (init 0,2,3,etc.)
the rc[0-6] script executes those scripts in /etc/rc[0-6].d that are 
prefixed with 'K' followed by those scripts prefixed with 'S'.

EXAMPLE: When changing to init state 2 (default multi-user mode),
	/sbin/rc2 is initiated by the init process. The following
	steps are performed by /sbin/rc2.

	1. In the directory /etc/rc2.d are files used to stop processes 
	that should not be running in state 2.  The filenames
	are prefixed with 'K'.  Each 'K'  file in the directory is
	executed (by /sbin/rc2) in alpha-numeric order when the system 
	enters init state 2.  (see example under next item).

	2. Also in the rc2.d directory are files used to start
	processes that should be running in state 2.  As in the step
	above, each 'S' file is executed.

	Example:

		The file /etc/netdaemon is a script that will initiate
		networking daemons when given the argument 'start',
		and will terminate the daemons if given the argumant
		'stop'.  It is linked to /etc/rc2.d/S68netdaemon,
		and to /etc/rc0.d/K67netdaemon.  
		It file is executed by '/etc/rc2.d/S68netdaemon start'
		when init state 2 is entered and by
		'/etc/rc0.d/S67netdaemon stop' when shutting the 
		system down.

NOTE:
/sbin/rc2 has references to the obsolescent 'rc.d' directory.  These
references are for compatibility with old INSTALL scripts. New
INSTALL scripts should use the init.d directory for related executables.
The same is true for the shutdown.d directory.
