# US Daylight Saving Time ended on the last Sunday of *October* in 1974.
# See, for example, the front page of the Saturday, October 26, 1974
# and Sunday, October 27, 1974 editions of the Washington Post.

# Note also this from seismo!munnari!kre:
# "I recall also being told by someone once that Canada didn't have
# the DST variations in 74/75 that the US did, but I am not nearly
# sure enough of this to add anything."
# The above has been confirmed by Bob Devine; we'll go with it here.
