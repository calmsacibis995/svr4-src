# New South Wales and subjurisdictions have their own ideas of a fun time.
# Based on law library research by john@basser.cs.su.oz, who notes:
#	In Australia, time is not legislated federally, but rather by the
#	individual states.  Thus, while such terms as ``Eastern Standard Time''
#	[I mean, of course, Australian EST, not any other kind] are in common
#	use, _they have NO REAL MEANING_, as they are not defined in the
#	legislation.  This is very important to understand. 
#	I have researched New South Wales time only; . . .I hope that perhaps a
#	resident of each state could be found to do it for their own state. 
#	(And I can guarantee that Victoria and NSW are different, so the link
#	between them in the current australasia file must be broken.)

#	. . .
#	I am including a description of Australian time zones. . .
#	this stuff is definitely accurate.
#	. . .
#	a) Australian Eastern Time: (EST = GMT+10:00, EDT = GMT+11:00)
#	. . .
#	Summer of 86/87 - present (current legislation):
#		third Sun Oct 02:00 EST -> third LSun Mar 02:00 EST
#
# If this turns out to be true, substitute Sun<=21 (third Sunday in October)
# for Sun<=24 (next-to-last Sunday in October) above. . .some time before
# October 1988, the first time it makes a difference.
