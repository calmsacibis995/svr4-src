# From Official Airline Guide - Worldwide Edition (1987).  Countries not
# listed here do not observe DST, according to the OAG.  Time zone names
# are pure inventions, and none are supplied for countries not observing
# DST; updates from natives would be appreciated.  The times that DST
# starts and ends are based on the assumption that they switch a 2AM just
# as everybody else does.

# Brazil
# The OAG lists October 25, 1987 and February 12, 1988 as the starting and
# ending dates, giving them as "estimated date(s) based on previous year".  We
# infer a rule here from one example, always a dangerous practice....  Yes,
# they really do switch on Saturday, according to the OAG.
# "Brazil/Acre" is for the Territory of Acre; "Brazil/DeNoronha" is for
# Fernando De Noronha.
