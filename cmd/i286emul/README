These are the files needed to make the 286 emulator, and what they
contain:

	i286emul.mk             the makefile
	Sbreak.c                (s)brk interface
	Signal.c                signal interface
	exec.c                  loads 286 binary
	gethead.c               used by exec.c
	i286sys                 286 header files
	ipc.c                   IPC interface
	main.c
	miscsys.c               interfaces for various system calles
	run286.s                starts execution in 286 mode
	sendsig.s               delivers signals to 286 code
	setdscr.c               manipulates GDT and LDT
	syscall.c               dispatches system calls
	syscalla.s              286 syscall call gate points here
	sysent.c                table telling how to handle system calls
	sysent.h
	text.c                  used by exec.c
	utils.c                 random routines
	vars.h                  defines and declares globals

Note that the kernel expects the emulator to be names /bin/i286emul.
When someone attempts to exec a 286 binary, the exec is changed to
an exec of the emulator as follows:

	prog286 arg1 arg2 arg3 ... argN

becomes

	/bin/i286emul arg1 arg2 arg3 ... argN prog286
