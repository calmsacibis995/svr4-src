Lockset package - @(#)@(#)README	1.1	13:07:50	8/31/89

OTHER REQUIRED PACKAGES:
	(none)

This directory contains all the headers and functions necessary to maintain
a consistant locking mechanism among cooperating processes.  The following
files are visible to the outside world:

	lockset.h	- externally visable constants and declarations
	liblset.a	- this is the actual library

The other header files are only for internal use, and should never be accessed
by an external user.  The source files are all available via the library
itself, and should not be accessed directly.

The internal files to this package are:

	internal.h	- standard constant and type definitions, and tuning
			  parameters.  i.e., there may be machine dependencies,
			  but the file should be changed only for efficiency,
			  it should compile as is.
	lockset.c	- global variables
	lset_estr.c	- error strings
	lsetclr.c	- clear a given lockset
	lsetcount.c	-  count the number of locks in a lockset
	lsetnew.c	- create a new lockset
	lsetrmv.c	- remove a lockset
	lsetset.c	- set a lock in a lockset
	lsetuse.c	- open a lockset for use
