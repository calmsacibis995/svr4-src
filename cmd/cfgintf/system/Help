TITLE:the System Name Information screen

ABSTRACT:
	The "system" task generates a report containing the name of the system, 
	the system's node name, the system release number, the system version 
	number, and the hardware for which the kernel was built.

LISTING:
	This screen describes the name of the machine and the versions of the
	operating system running on that machine.
	
	The first line is the system name.  At some sites, the system name is
	the name of the machine, at others, it is the name of the operating
	system.  The second line is the network node name of the machine.  The
	third line is the operating system release number, the fourth is the
	operating system version number, and the fifth line is the machine for
	which the operating system was built.
