ABSTRACT:
	The add task allows you to tell your system which systems
	to contact and at what times to contact them.

psys:System
	Give the name of a system that you want Basic Networking
	to contact automatically.  The system name must be an
	entry in the first field of /etc/uucp/Systems.

ptimes:Time
	Enter a comma or space separated list of integers between O
	and 23, including ranges specified with hyphens.
devices:add_devices
	The devices menu allows you to administer the characteristics
	of the devices used by the Basic Networking Utilities.  A 
	device is specified by giving its type, a particular port, and 
	the speed and dialing procedure to be used on the port.  A device
	is selected for use by Basic Networking based on the device type
	and speed required.  Thus, several devices may have the same
	type or the same speed, and Basic Networking may attempt to 
	connect to a remote system by trying several devices in turn.

polling:add_polling
	The polling menu allows you to administer the times at
	which remote systems are called by the Basic Networking
	Utilities.

systems:add_systems
	The systems menu allows you to manage information that 
	Basic Networking Utilities stores about remote systems.
	This information is necessary for your system and remote
	systems to communicate via mail or uucp.
