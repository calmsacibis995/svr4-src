ABSTRACT:Setup
	The setup task allows you to initialize the Basic Networking
	Utilities databases in the directory /etc/uucp.  The order in
	which these files are setup is important. Devices should be
	added first, followed by Systems, and lastly Systems to Poll. 
	Basic Networking Utilities databases are necessary for
	your system and remote systems to communicate via mail or uucp.

devices:add_devices
	The devices menu allows you to administer the characteristics
	of the devices used by the Basic Networking Utilities.  A 
	device is specified by giving its type, a particular port, and 
	the speed and dialing procedure to be used on the port.  A device
	is selected for use by Basic Networking based on the device type
	and speed required.  Thus, several devices may have the same
	type or the same speed, and Basic Networking may attempt to 
	connect to a remote system by trying several devices in turn.

polling:add_polling
	The polling menu allows you to administer the times at
	which remote systems are called by the Basic Networking
	Utilities.

systems:add_systems
	The systems menu allows you to manage information that 
	Basic Networking Utilities stores about remote systems.
	This information is necessary for your system and remote
	systems to communicate via mail or uucp.
