ABSTRACT:
	The list task allows you to display information about the
	devices over which your system can initiate communication
	with other systems.  A device may be a directly connected
	host, a modem, or a TLI network interface.  A port that
	supports incoming traffic only can be used by BNU to 
	receive messages; such usage does not require any device
	administration.

ddlist:Device Type
	Choose the type of device about which you want to obtain
	information.  Choose "All" if you want to see information
	about all devices.

dplist:Port
	Choose the port for which you want to obtain information
	about connected devices.  Choose "All" if you want to see
	information about devices on all ports.
