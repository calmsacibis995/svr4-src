ABSTRACT:
	The devices menu allows you to administer the characteristics
	of the devices used by the Basic Networking Utilities.  A 
	device is specified by giving its type, a particular port, and 
	the speed and dialing procedure to be used on the port.  A device
	is selected for use by Basic Networking based on the device type
	and speed required.  Thus, several devices may have the same
	type or the same speed, and Basic Networking may attempt to 
	connect to a remote system by trying several devices in turn.
