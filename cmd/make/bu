*   make(1) error messages
*
-1
"no description argument after -f flag"
make(1) requires a description file name to follow the -f
flag.  For further help see the manual page for make(1).
-2
"no viewpath argument after -v flag"
The make(1) command format requires a viewpath to be specified after
the -v flag.  For further help see the manual page for make(1).
-4
"viewpath name too long for array"
The buffer used to internally store the viewpath is limited to the
constant MAXVPATH (= 3*MAXNAMLEN = 512*3 characters).
-5
"getcwd"
An error occurred during the execution of the system routine getcwd(3C).
-6
"viewpath contains non-existent directory"
A directory listed in the specified viewpath doesn't exist OR read
permission for that directory has not been granted.
-7
"no arguments or description file"
No makefile was found.
-9
"Description file error"
An error occurred while parsing the makefile.
-10
"too many command lines for '...' "
Only a single set of commands is allowed for a particular target. 
Although the makefile may contain multiple occurrences of the same
target, only one of those occurrences may contain a command set.  (A
command set may contain only one command.) 
-11
"too many criteria for <target>"
Only a single set of criteria is allowed for a particular target. 
Although the makefile may contain multiple occurrences of the same
target, only one of those occurrences may contain a set of criteria.
-12
"warning: cannot copy <file>"
A system copy error occurred while copying the specified library file
into the user's node.
-13
"Don't know how to make <target>"
make(1) was unable to find the specified target and there
was not sufficient information to generate it.
-14
"<target> not remade because of errors"
While processing the above target, errors were encountered.  Processing
continued since these errors were flagged as 'ignorable'.
-15
"warning: cannot copy <file>"
A system copy error occurred while attempting to copy the specified
file.  Check to see that the file actually exists and is accessible.
-16
"warning: <file> not removed"
This error should only occur in connection with error (bu15).  This is
either a system copy error as indicated in (bu15), or a bug in
make(1).
-17
"cannot open <file>"
A system error occurred while attempting to open <file> for reading.
-18
"cannot open <file>"
A system error occurred while attempting to open <file> for writing.
-19
"cp: fread error"
A system error has occurred while attempting the system function
fread().
-20
"cp: fwrite error"
A system error has occurred while attempting the system function
fwrite().
-21
"*** Error code '...' " OR  "*** Termination code '   ' "
This error is reported but does not occur in make(1).  It
is associated with the last command executed.  See the UNIX manual for
additional information on the error codes for that command.  If
"ignored" has been printed on the line immediately following the above 
error message, this error is ignored by make(1).  Errors
will be ignored if the -i option was set on execution, or if the dummy
target .IGNORE appears in the makefile, or if the particular command was
prefaced with a minus sign (-).
-22
"couldn't load shell"
This system error could result if the system is overloaded.  Try again.
-23
"bad wait code"
This system error could result if the system is overloaded.  Try again. 
-24
"cannot load <file>"
This system error may occur if the command doesn't exist.  No further
help available.
-25
"cannot touch <file>"
An error has occurred with either open(), close(), write(), creat(), or
the file to be touched doesn't exist.
-28
"<file> is not an archive"
In targets of the form lib((e)) and lib(m), lib must be a UNIX archive.
-31
"out of memory"
A call to the system function calloc() has resulted in the return of a
null pointer.  There is either no available memory or the arena has been
detectably corrupted by storing outside the bounds of a block.
-32
"infinitely recursive macro?"
The macro nesting depth has exceeded 100 levels.  An infinitely
recursive macro is probably the cause -- recheck your code.
-33
"warning: <macro> changed after being used"
The specified macro has been previously defined and used, and is now
being changed.  Recheck your code to make sure this is what you want. 
This is only a warning message.
-34
"line <lineno>: '......'"
The above error originated in YACC.
-35
"$? list too long"
Ignore this error message if you are not using the macro $? in the
makefile.  If you are, the list of names in $? will be incomplete.
-36
"inconsistent rules lines for <target>"
The specified target was used in both single colon (:) and double colon
mode (::).  One consistent mode must be used for multiple occurrences of
the same target.
-37
"multiple make lines for <target>"
Only a single set of commands is allowed for a particular target. 
Although the makefile may contain multiple occurrences of the same
target, only one of those occurrences may contain a command set.  (A
command set may contain only one command.)
-38
"multiple build criteria for <target>"
Only a single set of build criteria is allowed for a particular target. 
Although the makefile may contain multiple occurrences of the same
target, only one of those occurrences may contain a set of build
criteria.
-39
"must be a separator on rules line <lineno>"
If the command begins a newline it must be preceded by a tab.  Check to
see that a tab has been used, rather than 7 spaces.  Commands that occur
on the same line must be separated by semicolons.  Comment lines must
begin with a '#'.
-40
"bad character ' ' (octal ' ')"
The specified bad character was encountered while parsing the makefile.
-41
"line too long"
The length of an input line is limited by the constant INMAX (=1500),
defined in ../build/defs.h.  This problem may possibly be solved by
using multiple target occurrences to break up long lists of
dependencies.
-42
"don't know how to make <target>"
make(1) was unable to find the specified target and couldn't
find sufficient information in the makefile to generate the it.
-43
"<file> is not an object module"
<file> is not in the format specified by a.out(4).
-44
"improper viewpath specification"
The first node in the viewpath includes a directory which is not in the
path of the current working directory.  Check the spelling of the node
name.  If it is correct, see the manual page for make(1) for an
explanation of the viewpath concept.
-45
"hash table overflow"
The makefile being parsed contains in excess of HASHSIZE(=506) names
which have to be stored in make(1).  Decrease the number of
targets in the makefile, break the makefile into two or more makefiles.
