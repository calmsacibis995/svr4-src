ABSTRACT: Selective Report of Pending Restore Requests
	The "selective" task allows you to display a report of pending
	restore requests selected by jobid, user or destination device.  If
	you choose to select on jobid, user and destination device (or on
	any pair of these), the display will consist of status log entries
	that satisfy all of them.  For example, if you specify selection
	based on user "root" and destination device type "diskette", then
	the display will list only those entries with destination device
	types of "diskette" which were initiated by user "root".

TITLE: Selective Report of Pending Restore Requests

F1: Jobids
	"Jobids:"  Enter a comma- or blank-separated list of restore jobids
	(of the form "rest-NA", where N is a number of digits and A is a
	letter) or the keyword "all" (which is the default).  These are the
	only restore requests you want to appear on this listing of the
	report.

F2: Users
	"Users:"  Enter a comma- or blank-separated list of login ids
	valid for this machine or the keyword "all" (which is the
	default).  These are the users whose restore request status you
	want to see.

F3: Destination device type
	"Destination device type:"  Enter a device type valid for this
	machine or the keyword "all" (which is the default).  This is the
	type of device that was used to create the backup from which this
	restore request will be satisfied.  Only entries in the status log
	whose device types match the value entered will be displayed.

F4: Destination volume labels
	"Destination volume labels:"  Enter volume labels for which
	there may be restore requests waiting or the keyword "all".
