ABSTRACT: Restore Request Login
	The "operator" task allows you to set the restore request operator
	login.  This login will be notified by mail whenever a restore
	request that requires operator intervention is queued.

TITLE: Restore Request Login

F1:Restore Operator Assign Field
	"Restore operator xxx assigned ddd:"  where "xxx" is the login
	currently assigned as the restore request operator and "ddd" is the
	date that operator was assigned.  If no operator has been assigned
	yet, both "xxx" and "ddd" are blank.  You may enter the login which
	should become the restore operator in this field and press [SAVE]
	to save the change.  If you [CANCEL] or [QUIT], the operator login
	will stay as it is.
