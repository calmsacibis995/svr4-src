ABSTRACT: Restore Service
	The Restore From Removable Media Menu enables you to restore files
	to your hard disk that were backed up to removable media. You can
	restore files from your HOME directory as well as system files that
	were backed up. You must have system administration privileges to
	perform a system restore.
	
	The items on the Restore From Removable Media Menu are:
	
	Personal Restore:  You can restore all of your own files
	(directories or regular files) or selectively restore particular
	files that were backed up from your HOME directory.
	
	System Restore:  You can restore all files or selectively
	restore specific files that were backed up.  You can do a
	restore from system backup, do a selective system restore, or
	restore other user files. You must have system administration
	privileges to do this.
