ABSTRACT: Respond to Backup Job Requests

	The "backup_respond" task allows you to interact with backup
	operations that require operator intervention.  This is the
	mechanism used to respond to requests for operator intervention
	for backup jobs executed in background (default) mode.  You
	must select which operations you want to interact with by
	specifying the login of the user who started the backup job(s).
	
	NOTE: This task clears the screen and puts you into scrolling
	mode.  When the task is finished executing, you will be prompted
	to press <RETURN> to return to the screen-based mode.
