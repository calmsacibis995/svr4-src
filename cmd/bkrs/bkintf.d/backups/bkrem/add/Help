ABSTRACT: Add Entries to Backup Reminder Schedule
	The "add" task allows you to add entries to the backup reminder
	message schedule.  Each entry contains when the backup reminder
	message should appear (time, days of the week and month) as well as
	which originating object names should be included in the reminder.
	For example, you may want to be reminded at 5:00pm every weekday
	that the /usr file system backup needs to be run.

TITLE: Add Entries to Backup Reminder Schedule

F1:Time Field
	"Time:"  Enter the time of day at which the backup reminder message
	should appear.  The time is represented by a string of the form
	hh:mm, where hh is 00-23 and mm is 00-59.  For example, for the
	message to appear at 8:15pm, enter "20:15".

F2:Day(s) Field
	"Day(s):"  Enter a list of weekdays on which this message should
	appear.  Days are represented by the digits 0 (=Sunday) to 6
	(=Saturday).  You may enter the keyword "all" if the reminder
	message is to appear every day.

F3:Month(s) Field
	"Month(s):"  Enter a list of months (1-12) in which this reminder
	is to appear.  You may represent ranges of months by month numbers
	separated by a "-".  For example, for the message to appear from
	July through December, enter "7-12".  You may enter the keyword
	"all" if the reminder should appear every month.

F4:Originating Name(s) Field
	"Originating Name(s):"  Enter the names of the objects about whose
	backup you want to be reminded.  For example, if you want to be
	reminded to back up the /usr file system, enter "/usr" in this
	field. You may enter the keyword "all" if you want to be reminded
	to back up all file systems and data partitions (if any).
