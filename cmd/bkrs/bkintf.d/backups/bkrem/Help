ABSTRACT: Reminder Schedule for Backup Jobs
	The "reminder" menu allows you to manage the schedule of backup
	reminder messages.  You can schedule reminders to be mailed to root
	notifying you that certain file systems are due to be backed up.
	Tasks are provided to add reminders to the schedule, to change
	existing scheduled reminders, to remove entries from the reminder
	schedule and to display the current schedule.
	
	Note that the backup reminders only notify you that the time has
	come to back up your file systems.  You must still invoke the
	backup command or schedule backups to run automatically in order
	to back up your file systems and data partitions.
