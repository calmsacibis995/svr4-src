ABSTRACT: Setup Backup Control Table
	The "setup" menu subcommands allow you to create, modify and
	display the contents of the backup control table(s).  You may
	also modify the backup rotation period and current week of the
	rotation for a backup table.
	
	The backup table embodies the backup scheme for a given
	computer.  It contains information about what is to be backed
	up, how and when. The entire scheme is based on the specified
	rotation period.  This is a period in weeks that designates
	when backup operations are repeated.  Each entry in a backup
	table contains a designation of weeks and days of the rotation
	on which this backup operation will occur.  For example, if
	the rotation period is one week and the backup table contains
	an entry to back up the /usr file system every weekend durring
	week 1 of the rotation, then every weekday of every week the
	/usr file system will be backed up (assuming that the backup
	command is run each weekday of every week).
	
	Each entry in a backup table corresponds to a backup operation
	and is identified by a tag that is unique within that table.
	It is a good idea to make the tag meaningful to those who will
	be running the backups.  For example, the tag could describe
	the object to be backed up and the frequency with which the
	backup operation will take place ("usrdai" would be the /usr
	file system's daily backup).
	
	Each backup table entry describes the object (file system or
	data partition) that is to be backed up, when the backup is
	to take place (which weeks and days of the backup rotation
	period), what method is to be used (for example, full file,
	incremental file, full disk, etc.), the destination device and
	volumes to be used to hold the archived data, the priority at
	which the backup is to be run and any other backups on which 
	this one depends.
