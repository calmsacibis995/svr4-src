ABSTRACT: Rotation Period Modification
	The "rotation" task allows you to modify the rotation period (in
	weeks) for a backup register.  You may also modify the value of the
	current week of the rotation.  If you do not change it, but you do
	modify the rotation period, the current week will default to the
	value displayed.  In general, when you change the rotation period,
	you will want the current week of the rotation to be 1.
	
	The rotation period and current week are used to determine which
	backups will be run on a given day.  For example, if today is
	Tuesday of the third week of the rotation period, then backups
	to be run today are those in the backup register for week 3, day 
	2.
	
	The default for each of these values is the value currently in the
	backup register.
	
	This form displays the values of the rotation period and current
	week in the backup register you specified.
