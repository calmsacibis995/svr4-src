ABSTRACT: Remove Entries in Backup Exception List
	The "remove" task allows you to remove entries from the exception
	list.  Note that the patterns you specify must match an exception
	list entry exactly in order to remove it from the list.  For
	example, if you want to remove the pattern "/tmp/*" from the
	exception list, you must specify "/tmp/*" as the pattern.

TITLE: Remove Entries in Backup Exception List

F1:
	"File Name:" Enter the exception list file name.

F2:
	"Patterns:"  Enter a list of patterns to be removed from the
	exception list.  The list items may be separated by commas or by
	blanks.  Patterns that are removed will be printed at your terminal
	as verification.
