ABSTRACT: Add Patterns to the Backup Exception List
	The "add" task allows you to add patterns to the backup exception
	list.  Patterns must be in cpio-style format (using metacharacters
	*?[]).  The character "*" matches any number of occurrences of any
	character.  The character "?" matches one occurrence of any
	character.  Characters between the square brackets "[]" match any
	occurrence of any character in the brackets.  For example, the
	pattern [0-9] matches one occurrence of any digit.
	
	To match all files and directories under a certain directory, enter
	the path to the directory and follow it by "/*".  For example, to
	exclude all files under the /tmp directory, enter the pattern
	"/tmp/*".
	
	To match all files on the system which have a particular name, no
	matter where they occur on the system, precede the file name by "*/".
	For example, to exclude all files named "a.out" from the backup,
	enter the pattern "*/a.out".
	
	To exclude one particular file from the backup, enter the full path
	to that file.  For example, to exclude the file "/etc/wtmp" from the
	backup, enter the patter "/etc/wtmp".
