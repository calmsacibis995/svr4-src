ABSTRACT: Display Entries in Backup Exception List
	The "display" task displays all or selected entries in the backup
	exception list.

TITLE: Display Entries in Backup Exception List

F1:
	"File Name:" Enter the exception list file name.

F2:Patterns Field
	"Patterns:"  Enter a list of patterns for entries you want to
	display or the keyword "all" to see the entire exception list.
	A pattern that begins with "/" specifies that entries in the
	list beginning with that pattern should be displayed.  A
	pattern that does not begin with "/" will cause any entries
	containing it to be displayed.  For example, to display
	exception list entries that begin with "/usr", specify the
	pattern "/usr".  To display entries that contain the string
	"usr", specify "usr" as the pattern.
