ABSTRACT: Exception List Display/Modify
	The "exception_list" menu allows you to display or modify the
	entries in the backup exception list.  This list contains
	cpio-style patterns that specify files and directories that
	should not be backed up when an incremental backup is run.
	Temporary files, scratch files and files that can easily be
	recreated from other files are good candidates for the
	exception list.  These are files that people would not need
	to have restored in the event that they are accidentally
	removed or damaged.
