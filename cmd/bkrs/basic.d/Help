ABSTRACT: Backup
	The Backup to Removable Media Menu lets you make a copy of the
	files you have on your computer's hard disk.

	You can back up all files (system and user), only the files updated
	since the last backup, an individual user's files, or selected
	files/directories.

	When copying to floppy, be sure to have several formatted floppy
	disks, depending on the amount of information you have on your
	system.
	
	The items on the Backup to Removable Media Menu are:
	
	Backup History:  Displays the date and time of the last
	system backup and incremental backup.

	Personal Backup:  Performs a backup of all files or selected
	files in your HOME directory.

	Schedule System Backup:  You can schedule, ahead of time, a
	system backup and/or incremental system backup. Also, you can
	delete a previously scheduled backup request or show a list of
	currently scheduled backups. Adding, changing, or deleting a
	backup request requires system administration privileges.

	System Backup:  You can backup all system and user files that
	have been modified or created since your system was installed.
	You must have system administration privileges to do this.
