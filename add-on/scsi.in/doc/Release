    CD-ROM and WORM target driver Release Notes

		   Oct. 15, 1989


1. Target driver installation:
	The installation of the CD-ROM and WORM target drivers is same as
	DISK and TAPE target driver.
	The CD-ROM and WORM drivers are installed by Install command in
	the pkg directory.
	And they are removed by Remove command.


2. Driver instruction
	See cdrom(7) and worm(7).


3. Bug
	worm(7)
		Currently, WORM driver doesn't support logical unit 1 to 7.
		Only logical unit 0 is supported.

		Reason:
		The SCSI controller of the WM-D070 or WM-C050 is able to
		connect	more 7 logical units.
		But, when you send 'INQUIRY' command to unconnected logical
		unit, it will not return 'Check Condition' but 'Good'.
		We don't apply this spec to sdi_config()
		Therefore, we only support 1 logical unit per 1 controller.
		Normally, it is no problem because logical unit is 1.
		Some future day, this bug is going to be fixed.

5. How to make the CD-ROM and WORM target driver

	step1:	copy the CD-ROM and WORM target driver source from FD.

		caution:
			The following files is changed for CD-ROM & WOM.
			add-on/scsi/ID/Makefile
			add-on/scsi/install/Install
			add-on/scsi/install/Remove
			add-on/scsi/io/Makefile
			add-on/scsi/sys/Makefile

	step2:	copy the follwing header files to /usr/include/sys directory.
		./add-on/scsi/sys/cdrom.h
		./add-on/scsi/sys/worm.h
		./add-on/scsi/io/sc01/sc01.h
		./add-on/scsi/io/sc01/sw01.h

	The following steps is same as DISK and TAPE driver's
	installation.

	step3:	make package files.
		# cd ./add-on/scsi
		# make install

	step4:	package installation.
		# sh ./Install

		caution:
			If your kernel includes DISK or TAPE target driver,
			you have to remove it before installation.


6. How to use the sc01qa
	The sc01qa is a menu style test tool of the CD-ROM target driver.
	Following the menu, you can use CD-ROM ioctl command.

	example of the Music start)

# ./sc01qa /dev/rcdrom/cd0

------------- CD-ROM menu -----------------------------------------------
cdtestunit	cdrezeunit	cdreqsense	cdinquiry 	cdmodsense
cdstrtunit	cdstopunit	cdprevmv  	cdallomv  	cdreadcapa
cdseek    	cdread    	cdsearch	cdaudio   	cdstill
cdtrayopen	cdtrayclose	
!		?		q		

Enter command ---> cdsearch
cdsearch command executing
enter param: 1(play), 0(pause) ---> 1
enter type:  0(logical), 1(ATIME), 2(track) ---> 2
enter track No. ---> 2

Enter command ---> q
#

	The source file is ./add-on/scsi/test/sc01qa/sc01qa.c and
	makefile is ./add-on/scsi/test/sc01qa/sc01qa.mk.


7. How to use the sw01qa
	The sw01qa is a menu style test tool of the WORM target driver.
	Following the menu, you can use WORM ioctl command.

	example of the load cartridge)

# ./sw01qa /dev/rworm/wm0

------------- WORM menu -------------------------------------------------
wmtestunit	wmrezeunit	wmreqsense	wminquiry 	wmmodsense
wmstrtunit	wmstopunit	wmprevmv  	wmallomv  	wmreadcapa
wmseek    	wmread    	wmwrite   	wmstncheck	wmreadcb  
wmcheck   	wmccheck  	wmread    	wmloadcart	wmunloadca
wmwritever	wmverify  	
!		?		q		

Enter command ---> wmloadcart


Enter command ---> q
#

	The source file is ./add-on/scsi/test/sw01qa/sw01qa.c and
	makefile is ./add-on/scsi/test/sw01qa/sw01qa.mk.
