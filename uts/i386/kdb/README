Kernel debugger support is implemented with several modules.
A single common module provides basic support services and interface to
the kernel.  This is combined with one or more actual debugger modules.
Multiple debuggers may reside in the same kernel; they will each provide
commands to switch between debuggers.

This directory contains common header files and the top-level makefile.

The "cmd" subdirectory contains user-level utility commands.

The "kdb-util" subdirectory contains the common support module.

The "kdb" subdirectory contains the KDB debugger.

The "gdebugger" subdirectory contains the GDEBUGGER debugger.
