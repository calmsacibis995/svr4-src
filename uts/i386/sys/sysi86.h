 *   The request structure declared below is used by the XENIX 286 emulator

 *   The SI86SHRGN subcommand is used by the XENIX 286 emulator to support

 *   pointer to an xsdbuf struct.
 *

 *   using the SI86SHRGN subcommand to set up XENIX small model shared data 
 *   context switching support for a given XENIX shared data segment.  In this 
 *   case, the xsdbuf struct contains the start addr for the shared data in 
 *   386 space, followed by the start addr for the shared data in the 286 
 *   executable's private data.  
 *
 *   If the 'xsd_cmd' field is SI86SHR_SZ, the XENIX 286 emulator is using the 
 *   SI86SHRGN subcommand to retrieve the size of an existing XENIX shared 
 *   data segment.  In this case, the xsdbuf struct contains the start addr
 *   for the shared data in 386 space.
 *   The size of the shared data segment starting at 'xsd_386vaddr' will
 *   be returned in the 'xsd_size' field by sysi86().
