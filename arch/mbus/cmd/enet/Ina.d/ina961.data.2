#	the iSXM 552A Ethernet controller. The maximum length of this field
#	is 12 characters.
#
# 2:	The "BUS Type" is either 'MB1', 'MB2' or 'AT386' depending on which
#	type of Ethernet controller (iSXM 552A, iSBC 186/530, or PCLINK/2) is
#	installed in your system.
#
# 3:	This column specifies whether or not the iNA961 version supports
#	iNA961 1.x to iNA961 3.x interoperability feature. "N/A" is specified

#	or a layer that supports ES-IS routing. The maximum length of this
#	field is 9 characters.
#
# 7:	This column specifies whether or not there is an external interface to
#	the Data Link layer. This field is either 'yes' or 'no'.
