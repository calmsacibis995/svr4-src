The UNIX System V Release 4 source code

This repository contains the UNIX System V Release 4 source code. Right now, I haven't uploaded the entire source code, but I will be doing that in the upcoming weeks.

:mk - Builds everything. (commands, libraries, kernel, the /usr/ucb BSD-compatibility commands, etc.)

:mkcmd - Builds all the commands.
